The data can be viewed in a range of formats including an overview showing counts and rates, interactive maps, spine charts and graphs that show temporal trends over a range of time scales or allow correlations between pairs of indicators. The aim of the AMR local indicators profile on Fingertips is to support the development of local action plans to optimize antibiotic prescribing and reduce AMR and healthcare-associated infections.

The Delhi Chapter of the Indian Association of Medical Microbiologists (IAMM-DC) organized a 1 day workshop in collaboration with BSAC on 10 December 2015 in New Delhi to design a road map towards the development of a robust antifungal stewardship programme in the context of conditions in India. The workshop aimed at developing a road map for optimizing better outcomes in patients with IFIs while minimizing unintended consequences of antifungal use, ultimately leading to reduced healthcare costs and prevention development of resistance to antifungals. The workshop was a conclave of all stakeholders, eminent experts from India and the UK, including clinical microbiologists, critical care specialists and infectious disease physicians. Various issues in managing IFIs were discussed, including epidemiology, diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms in different healthcare settings. At the end of the deliberations, a consensus opinion and key messages were formulated, outlining a step-by-step approach to tackling the growing incidence of IFIs and antifungal resistance, particularly in the Indian scenario.</td><td>['Antifungal Agents', 'Drug Resistance, Fungal', 'Drug Utilization', 'Health Policy', 'Humans', 'India', 'Mycoses', 'United Kingdom']</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>27999053</td><td>Effects of isoniazid resistance on TB treatment outcomes under programmatic conditions in a high-TB and -HIV setting: a prospective multicentre study.</td><td>['Nagu', 'Aboud', 'Matee', 'Maeurer', 'Fawzi', 'Mugusi']</td><td>2017</td><td>The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy</td><td>The scale and impact of background isoniazid resistance in TB- and HIV-endemic countries requires definition to improve treatment success and guide the scale-up of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT).

Loss of efficacy of antimicrobial substances can seriously compromise animal health and welfare. A need for the development of new antimicrobials for the therapy of multiresistant infections, particularly those caused by Gram-negative bacteria, has been acknowledged in human medicine and a future corresponding need in veterinary medicine is expected. A unique aspect related to antimicrobial resistance and risk of resistance transfer in companion animals is their close contact with humans. This creates opportunities for interspecies transmission of resistant bacteria. Yet, the current knowledge of this field is limited and no risk assessment is performed when approving new veterinary antimicrobials. The objective of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on the use and indications for antimicrobials in companion animals, drug-resistant bacteria of concern among companion animals, risk factors for colonization of companion animals with resistant bacteria and transmission of antimicrobial resistance (bacteria and/or resistance determinants) between animals and humans. The major antimicrobial resistance microbiological hazards originating from companion animals that directly or indirectly may cause adverse health effects in humans are MRSA, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, VRE, ESBL- or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and Gram-negative bacteria. In the face of the previously recognized microbiological hazards, a risk assessment tool could be applied in applications for marketing authorization for medicinal products for companion animals. This would allow the approval of new veterinary medicinal antimicrobials for which risk levels are estimated as acceptable for public health.</td><td>['Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Disease Transmission, Infectious', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Humans', 'Pets', 'Risk Assessment', 'Zoonoses']</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>27999066</td><td>HIV-1 diagnosis with unquantifiable viraemia: don't be naive, look for antiretroviral drugs.</td><td>['Wirden', 'Charpentier', 'Tubiana', 'Le', 'Desire', 'Dionou', 'Pichon', 'Valantin', 'Yasdanpanah', 'Descamps', 'Peytavin', 'Katlama', 'Calvez', 'Marcelin']</td><td>2017</td><td>The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy</td><td>null</td><td>['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Clinical Laboratory Techniques', 'Female', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-1', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Viral Load', 'Viremia']</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>27999067</td><td>Linezolid: a promising option in the treatment of Gram-positives.</td><td>['Zahedi Bialvaei', 'Rahbar', 'Yousefi', 'Asgharzadeh', 'Samadi Kafil']</td><td>2017</td><td>The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy</td><td>Linezolid, an oxazolidinone antimicrobial agent that acts by inhibiting protein synthesis in a unique fashion, is used in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, skin and soft-tissue infections and other infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria including VRE and methicillin-resistant staphylococci.

In this study, we monitored the transcriptomic divergence of the maize (Zea mays) inbred lines B73 and Mo17 and their reciprocal F1 hybrid progeny in primary roots under control and water deficit conditions simulated by polyethylene glycol treatment. Single-parent expression (SPE) of genes is an extreme instance of gene expression complementation, in which genes are active in only one of two parents but are expressed in both reciprocal hybrids. In this study, 1,997 genes only expressed in B73 and 2,024 genes only expressed in Mo17 displayed SPE complementation under control and water deficit conditions. As a consequence, the number of active genes in hybrids exceeded the number of active genes in the parental inbred lines significantly independent of treatment. SPE patterns were substantially more stable to expression changes by water deficit treatment than other genotype-specific expression profiles. While, on average, 75% of all SPE patterns were not altered in response to polyethylene glycol treatment, only 17% of the remaining genotype-specific expression patterns were not changed by water deficit. Nonsyntenic genes that lack syntenic orthologs in other grass species, and thus evolved late in the grass lineage, were significantly overrepresented among SPE genes. Hence, the significant overrepresentation of nonsyntenic genes among SPE patterns and their stability under water limitation might suggest a function of these genes during the early developmental manifestation of heterosis under fluctuating environmental conditions in hybrid progeny of the inbred lines B73 and Mo17.</td><td>['Chimera', 'Dehydration', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Genotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Zea mays']</td><td>['21036921', '25315323', '16641103', '22291134', '21266545', '18836034', '18562640', '26463995', '16666126', '21368132', '15194819', '17808529', '15604718', '24548794', '15342909', '21419688', '23913002', '24058158', '24485249', '16362278', '16702414', '19965430', '23086286', '11299398', '22174072', '14523245', '20613864', '20196867', '19956538', '19189423', '27208302', '15208399', '17720610', '16646809', '20456048', '22988280', '19895398', '16448564', '22438891', '15466289', '23324127', '23607940', '25174417', '16020790', '20150489', '16339807', '18387193', '23892661', '24488960', '21423772', '21624896', '22250127']</td></tr><tr><td>27999082</td><td>CNGC2 Is a Ca2+ Influx Channel That Prevents Accumulation of Apoplastic Ca2+ in the Leaf.</td><td>['Wang', 'Kang', 'Ma', 'Miao', 'Wu', 'Long', 'Ge', 'Wu', 'Hou', 'Zhang', 'Qi']</td><td>2017</td><td>Plant physiology</td><td>2+ dynamics in plant cells.</td><td>['Antiporters', 'Arabidopsis', 'Arabidopsis Proteins', 'Calcium', 'Cation Transport Proteins', 'Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Cation Channels', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Imaging', 'Mutation', 'Plant Leaves', 'Plants, Genetically Modified']</td><td>['20507535', '23093361', '8710949', '9636234', '12546823', '9843688', '11395435', '25944926', '1865907', '12893945', '25538725', '10751316', '17273915', '15141955', '20377677', '10069079', '12027380', '25494721', '25941764', '23671651', '19804716', '27298361', '17384171', '19461889', '26037390', '21865080', '21668596', '20699402', '23656893', '16055687', '21546457', '25966761', '26929345', '27061644', '24027242', '12805601', '18785824', '24889055', '10900264', '15234890', '24380879', '21642548', '18178643', '25614661', '10557223', '21258004', '20192754', '18536032', '23016135', '20448544', '19481494', '16645049', '11432906', '21511913', '20354197', '17363470', '12933363', '23695979', '23906906']</td></tr><tr><td>27999083</td><td>The Binding Specificity of the PHD-Finger Domain of VIN3 Moderates Vernalization Response.</td><td>['Kim', 'Sung']</td><td>2017</td><td>Plant physiology</td><td>Vernalization is a response to winter cold to initiate flowering in spring.

One of the main features of the GAS was the 'formation of acute erosions in the digestive tract, particularly in the stomach, small intestine and appendix'. This provided experimental evidence for the view based on clinical data that gastro-duodenal (peptic) ulcers could be caused by stress. This hypothesis was challenged by Marshall and Warren's Nobel Prize (2005)-winning discovery of a causal association between Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcers. However, clinical and experimental studies suggest that stress can cause peptic ulceration in the absence of H. pylori Predictably, the etiological pendulum of gastric and duodenal ulceration has swung from 'all stress' to 'all bacteria' followed by a sober realization that both factors play a role, separately as well as together. This raises the question as to whether stress and H. pylori interact, and if so, how? Stress has also been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and related disorders; however, there is no proof yet that stress is the primary etiological trigger for IBD. Central dopamine mechanisms seem to be involved in the stress induction of peptic ulceration, whereas activation of the sympathetic nervous system and central and peripheral corticotrophin-releasing factor appears to mediate stress-induced IBD.</td><td>['Helicobacter Infections', 'Helicobacter pylori', 'Humans', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Peptic Ulcer', 'Stress, Psychological', 'Syndrome']</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>27999086</td><td>Interplay between the endocrine and circadian systems in fishes.</td><td>['Isorna', 'de Pedro', 'Valenciano', 'Alonso-Gómez', 'Delgado']</td><td>2017</td><td>The Journal of endocrinology</td><td>The circadian system is responsible for the temporal organisation of physiological functions which, in part, involves daily cycles of hormonal activity. In this review, we analyse the interplay between the circadian and endocrine systems in fishes. We first describe the current model of fish circadian system organisation and the basis of the molecular clockwork that enables different tissues to act as internal pacemakers. This system consists of a net of central and peripherally located oscillators and can be synchronised by the light-darkness and feeding-fasting cycles. We then focus on two central neuroendocrine transducers (melatonin and orexin) and three peripheral hormones (leptin, ghrelin and cortisol), which are involved in the synchronisation of the circadian system in mammals and/or energy status signalling. We review the role of each of these as overt rhythms (i.e. outputs of the circadian system) and, for the first time, as key internal temporal messengers that act as inputs for other endogenous oscillators. Based on acute changes in clock gene expression, we describe the currently accepted model of endogenous oscillator entrainment by the light-darkness cycle and propose a new model for non-photic (endocrine) entrainment, highlighting the importance of the bidirectional cross-talking between the endocrine and circadian systems in fishes. The flexibility of the fish circadian system combined with the absence of a master clock makes these vertebrates a very attractive model for studying communication among oscillators to drive functionally coordinated outputs.</td><td>['Animals', 'CLOCK Proteins', 'Circadian Clocks', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Endocrine System', 'Fishes', 'Signal Transduction']</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>27999087</td><td>Acute effect of exercise intensity and duration on acylated ghrelin and hunger in men.</td><td>['Broom', 'Miyashita', 'Wasse', 'Pulsford', 'King', 'Thackray', 'Stensel']</td><td>2017</td><td>The Journal of endocrinology</td><td>2peak In both experiments, participants consumed standardised meals, and acylated ghrelin concentrations and hunger were quantified at predetermined intervals.

The main goal of this study was the production of recombinant gonadotropins (GtHs) on a large scale to serve as an alternative to currently used agents. We produced carp (c) recombinant (r) Lh as a single chain in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris Lha subunit was joined with Lhb subunit with a flexible linker of three glycine-serine repeats and six Histidines to form a mature protein, the β-subunit formed the N-terminal part and the α-subunit formed the C-terminal part. The ability of the rcLh to elicit biological response was tested by in vivo stimulation of estradiol (E2) and 17α,20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (DHP) and by its in vivo potency to induce ovulation and spawning induction. rcLh tested in this work significantly enhanced both E2 and DHP secretion in a dose-dependent manner similar to the results obtained with CPE. E2 levels showed a moderate rise following the priming injection and a subsequent decrease during the rest of the trial. DHP levels were only increased after the resolving injection, approximately 5 h before spawning. At the highest dose of rcLh (350 µg/kg BW), the recombinant protein was more efficient than CPE in terms of both spawning success and fertilization rate. It is shown here that rcLh can elicit the secretion of DHP in vivo and actually trigger spawning.

High-dose estrogen treatment has therefore been used to limit growth in extremely tall girls. However, recent data suggest that this treatment may have severe side effects, including increased risk of cancer and reduced fertility. We hypothesized that estrogenic effects in bone are mediated via ERα signaling. Twelve-week-old ovariectomized female C57BL/6 mice were subcutaneously injected for 4 weeks with E2 or selective ERα (PPT) or ERβ (DPN) agonists. After killing, tibia and femur lengths were measured, and growth plate morphology was analyzed. E2- and PPT-treated mice had shorter tibiae and femur bones when compared to vehicle-treated controls, whereas animals treated with DPN had similar bone lengths compared to controls. Growth plate height and hypertrophic zone height were reduced in animals treated with E2 or PPT but not in those treated with DPN, supporting that the effect was mediated via ERα. Moreover, PCNA staining revealed suppressed proliferation of chondrocytes in the tibia growth plate in PPT- or E2-treated mice compared to controls. Our data show that estrogenic effects on bone growth and growth plate maturation are mainly mediated via ERα.

Experiments confirmed 29 stabilizing point mutations, most of which were located in two distinct regions, whereas introduction of disulfide bonds was not effective. Combining the best mutations resulted in a 12-fold mutant (HheC-H12) with a 28°C higher apparent melting temperature and a remarkable increase in resistance to cosolvents. This variant also showed a higher optimum temperature for catalysis while activity at low temperature was preserved. Mutant H12 was used as a template for the introduction of mutations that enhance enantioselectivity or activity. Crystal structures showed that the structural changes in the H12 mutant mostly agreed with the computational predictions and that the enhanced stability was mainly due to mutations that redistributed surface charges and improved interactions between subunits, the latter including better interactions of water molecules at the subunit interfaces.</td><td>['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Computer Simulation', 'Hydrolases', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Protein Folding']</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>27999092</td><td>The epigenetic landscape of Alu repeats delineates the structural and functional genomic architecture of colon cancer cells.</td><td>['Jordà', 'Díez-Villanueva', 'Mallona', 'Martín', 'Lois', 'Barrera', 'Esteller', 'Vavouri', 'Peinado']</td><td>2017</td><td>Genome research</td><td>Cancer cells exhibit multiple epigenetic changes with prominent local DNA hypermethylation and widespread hypomethylation affecting large chromosomal domains. Epigenome studies often disregard the study of repeat elements owing to technical complexity and their undefined role in genome regulation. We have developed NSUMA (Next-generation Sequencing of UnMethylated Alu), a cost-effective approach allowing the unambiguous interrogation of DNA methylation in more than 130,000 individual Alu elements, the most abundant retrotransposon in the human genome. DNA methylation profiles of Alu repeats have been analyzed in colon cancers and normal tissues using NSUMA and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. Normal cells show a low proportion of unmethylated Alu (1%-4%) that may increase up to 10-fold in cancer cells. In normal cells, unmethylated Alu elements tend to locate in the vicinity of functionally rich regions and display epigenetic features consistent with a direct impact on genome regulation. In cancer cells, Alu repeats are more resistant to hypomethylation than other retroelements. Genome segmentation based on high/low rates of Alu hypomethylation allows the identification of genomic compartments with differential genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic features. Alu hypomethylated regions show low transcriptional activity, late DNA replication, and its extent is associated with higher chromosomal instability. Our analysis demonstrates that Alu retroelements contribute to define the epigenetic landscape of normal and cancer cells and provides a unique resource on the epigenetic dynamics of a principal, but largely unexplored, component of the primate genome.</td><td>['Alu Elements', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Genome, Human', 'Genomics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans']</td><td>['12702868', '14732866', '21706001', '20599551', '24035705', '7730313', '8531692', '25693563', '20062050', '22367878', '25693567', '20657582', '22028635', '26972587', '22156296', '25691127', '23708189', '16951157', '16204030', '8336699', '21208455', '25747664', '22820252', '25243180', '11867739', '20351280', '23618408', '22120008', '15952895', '20979621', '26257180', '22124482', '22955980', '16365381', '20125086', '22204421', '16518638', '26648264', '19881528', '26883630', '16326863', '26821878', '21593595', '18337604', '17234643', '16642018', '17045745', '26859682', '18463634', '23245995', '11782440', '26861146', '20602342', '20145203', '27053337', '18193158', '18463664', '23676707', '27589566', '21757246', '24368016', '17339880', '26827622', '26743714', '24703844', '21925323', '26223268', '23657480', '19763152', '20890131', '25798578', '22641018', '18533722', '27172225', '17020921', '26890526', '22716230', '15475419', '14751968', '26675734', '20852634', '15165906', '20376054', '23066096', '19829295', '26400176', '20488932', '17320505', '17483816', '25218583', '24669864', '20964632', '19268875', '19151715', '19060200', '25592537', '20944589', '25995269', '20495664', '7265238', '20430782', '19458156', '23246434', '20173741', '11932749', '18084025', '24794443', '25191524', '20163738', '11237011', '19966280', '19503096', '14973332']</td></tr><tr><td>27999093</td><td>A Case Report of Fatal Desmethyl Carbodenafil Toxicity.</td><td>['Bakota', 'Kelly', 'Walterscheid', 'Phatak']</td><td>2017</td><td>Journal of analytical toxicology</td><td>We present the case report of a 34-year-old Hispanic male who was found unresponsive in the carport of his residence.

We therefore studied the transcriptional regulation of hepatic Dpp4 in young mice prone to diet-induced obesity. Already at 6 weeks of age, expression of hepatic Dpp4 was increased in mice with high weight gain, independent of liver fat content. In the same animals, methylation of four intronic CpG sites was decreased, amplifying glucose-induced transcription of hepatic Dpp4 In older mice, hepatic triglyceride content was increased only in animals with elevated Dpp4 expression. Expression and release of DPP4 were markedly higher in the liver compared with adipose depots. Analysis of human liver biopsy specimens revealed a correlation of DPP4 expression and DNA methylation to stages of hepatosteatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. In summary, our results indicate a crucial role of the liver in participation to systemic DPP4 levels. Furthermore, the data show that glucose-induced expression of Dpp4 in the liver is facilitated by demethylation of the Dpp4 gene early in life. This might contribute to early deteriorations in hepatic function, which in turn result in metabolic disease such as hepatosteatosis later in life.</td><td>['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4', 'Fatty Liver', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glucose', 'Hepatocytes', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease', 'Triglycerides']</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>27999103</td><td>Effects of 13-Hour Hyperglucagonemia on Energy Expenditure and Hepatic Glucose Production in Humans.</td><td>['Chakravarthy', 'Parsons', 'Lassman', 'Butterfield', 'Lee', 'Chen', 'Previs', 'Spond', 'Yang', 'Bock', 'Yi', 'Moon', 'Wohlers-Kariesch', 'Smith', 'Meyer']</td><td>2017</td><td>Diabetes</td><td>Glucagon (GCG) acutely stimulates energy expenditure (EE) and hepatic glucose production (HGP) in humans, but whether these effects persist during hyperglucagonemia of longer duration is unclear.

In the current study, a fortuitous observation in transgenic mice globally overexpressing heparanase (hep-tg) was the discovery of improved glucose homeostasis. We examined the mechanisms that contribute toward this improved glucose metabolism. Heparanase overexpression was associated with enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and hyperglucagonemia, in addition to changes in islet composition and structure. Strikingly, the pancreatic islet transcriptome was greatly altered in hep-tg mice, with >2,000 genes differentially expressed versus control. The upregulated genes were enriched for diverse functions including cell death regulation, extracellular matrix component synthesis, and pancreatic hormone production. The downregulated genes were tightly linked to regulation of the cell cycle. In response to multiple low-dose streptozotocin (STZ), hep-tg animals developed less severe hyperglycemia compared with wild-type, an effect likely related to their β-cells being more functionally efficient. In animals given a single high dose of STZ causing severe and rapid development of hyperglycemia related to the catastrophic loss of insulin, hep-tg mice continued to have significantly lower blood glucose.

Essential components of the innate immune antiviral response, including type I interferon (IFN) and IFN receptor-mediated signaling pathways, are candidates for determining susceptibility to human type 1 diabetes. Numerous aspects of human type 1 diabetes pathogenesis are recapitulated in the LEW.1WR1 rat model. Diabetes can be induced in LEW.1WR1 weanling rats challenged with virus or with the viral mimetic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C). We hypothesized that disrupting the cognate type I IFN receptor (type I IFN α/β receptor [IFNAR]) to interrupt IFN signaling would prevent or delay the development of virus-induced diabetes. We generated IFNAR1 subunit-deficient LEW.1WR1 rats using CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9) genome editing and confirmed functional disruption of the Ifnar1 gene. IFNAR1 deficiency significantly delayed the onset and frequency of diabetes and greatly reduced the intensity of insulitis after poly I:C treatment. The occurrence of Kilham rat virus-induced diabetes was also diminished in IFNAR1-deficient animals. These findings firmly establish that alterations in innate immunity influence the course of autoimmune diabetes and support the use of targeted strategies to limit or prevent the development of type 1 diabetes.</td><td>['Animals', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1', 'Female', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Interferon Type I', 'Male', 'Parvovirus', 'Rats', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']</td><td>['12116172', '21303493', '24655297', '24965051', '19088288', '23562090', '24150607', '25430610', '6252275', '20827270', '22368175', '23676303', '23612114', '25129435', '25392246', '25849081', '21162649', '16625202', '24550192', '15469602', '11070174', '23643243', '19794063', '6784628', '16699517', '16714379', '11607032', '26061776', '24530055', '17202329', '12116173', '19628861', '12646622', '19324880', '1628761', '25591872', '20173777', '24611784', '24062197', '8009221', '12401717', '23287718', '24452267', '16123363', '24561305', '15793267', '23890997', '19264985', '19934004', '27020257', '8621003', '16330040', '9662409', '7479980', '22005987', '25398346']</td></tr><tr><td>27999107</td><td>Subclinical Disease Burden as Assessed by Whole-Body MRI in Subjects With Prediabetes, Subjects With Diabetes, and Normal Control Subjects From the General Population: The KORA-MRI Study.</td><td>['Bamberg', 'Hetterich', 'Rospleszcz', 'Lorbeer', 'Auweter', 'Schlett', 'Schafnitzel', 'Bayerl', 'Schindler', 'Saam', 'Müller-Peltzer', 'Sommer', 'Zitzelsberger', 'Machann', 'Ingrisch', 'Selder', 'Rathmann', 'Heier', 'Linkohr', 'Meisinger', 'Weber', 'Ertl-Wagner', 'Massberg', 'Reiser', 'Peters']</td><td>2017</td><td>Diabetes</td><td>Detailed pathophysiological manifestations of early disease in the context of prediabetes are poorly understood.

Based on individual-level gene expression data from 28 early third instar larvae, we test whether the same evolutionary dynamics that pertain to plastically expressed genes in adults also pertain to genes with plastic expression during development. In order to quantify plasticity of gene expression over multiple contrasts, we develop a novel geometric measure. For genes expressed during development, we show that plasticity of expression is positively correlated with evolutionary rates. We furthermore find a strong correlation between expression plasticity and expression variation within morphs, suggesting a close link between active and passive plasticity of gene expression.

We tested this idea by analyzing cell-specific gene expression across spermatogenesis in two lineages of house mice and their sterile and fertile reciprocal hybrids. We found pervasive disruption of sex chromosome gene expression in sterile hybrids at every stage of spermatogenesis. Failure of MSCI was developmentally preceded by increased silencing of autosomal genes, supporting the hypothesis that divergence at the hybrid incompatibility gene, Prdm9, results in increased rates of autosomal asynapsis which in turn triggers widespread silencing of unsynapsed chromatin. We also detected opposite patterns of postmeiotic overexpression or hyper-repression of the sex chromosomes in reciprocal hybrids, supporting the hypothesis that genomic conflict has driven functional divergence that leads to deleterious X-Y dosage imbalances in hybrids. Our developmental timeline also exposed more subtle patterns of mitotic misregulation on the X chromosome, a previously undocumented stage of spermatogenic disruption in this cross. These results indicate that multiple hybrid incompatibilities have converged on a common regulatory phenotype, the disrupted expression of the sex chromosomes during spermatogenesis. Collectively, these data reveal a composite regulatory basis to hybrid male sterility in mice that helps resolve the mechanistic underpinnings of the well-documented large X-effect in mice speciation.

The underlying structural basis that defines these two fold types is the mutually exclusive stacking of a backbone oxygen on either the first (in GNRA) or the last nucleobase (in UNCG), generating an oxygen-π contact. We thereby propose to refrain from using sequences to distinguish between loop conformations. Instead, we suggest using descriptors such as U-turn (for \"\"GNRA-type\"\" folds) and a newly described Z-turn (for \"\"UNCG-type\"\" folds). Because tetraloops adopt for the largest part only two (inter)convertible turns, we are better able to interpret from a structural perspective loop interchangeability occurring in ribosomes and viral RNA. In this respect, we propose a general view on the inclination for a given sequence to adopt (or not) a specific fold. We also suggest how long-noncoding RNAs may adopt discrete but transient structures, which are therefore hard to predict.\"</td><td>['Inverted Repeat Sequences', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nucleotide Motifs', 'RNA Folding', 'RNA, Viral', 'Ribosomes']</td><td>['24951555', '19759148', '7608979', '18773908', '7585251', '24590440', '12356306', '7578046', '26184874', '790568', '9000624', '25303371', '27923930', '19528080', '22240457', '27091499', '16817983', '11345429', '24214967', '23915736', '25780113', '10891269', '7489516', '27233937', '25883046', '1712983', '9159475', '14624001', '25780168', '20943759', '25838379', '11333014', '17370991', '15121895', '27819659', '2236056', '22938718', '11071808', '24679528', '16429156', '11027137', '26574468', '10903205', '772447', '19906714', '12592009', '26583558', '25780138', '27448410', '19239882', '20459631', '21935472', '16894217', '27151194', '16531589', '12693932', '21899297', '26488412', '11060012', '1696688', '22605553', '15814817', '21382373', '18263618']</td></tr><tr><td>27999113</td><td>Performance of mass spectrometry steroid profiling for diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome.</td><td>['Handelsman', 'Teede', 'Desai', 'Norman', 'Moran']</td><td>2017</td><td>Human reproduction (Oxford, England)</td><td>How well does multi-analyte steroid mass spectrometry (MS) profiling classify women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?</td><td>['Adult', 'Androgens', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Estrogens', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Immunoassay', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Polycystic Ovary Syndrome', 'Progestins']</td><td>['28575397']</td></tr><tr><td>27999114</td><td>Effect of pretreatment with oral contraceptives and progestins on IVF outcomes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.</td><td>['Wei', 'Shi', 'Li', 'Wang', 'Zhang', 'Sun', 'Zhou', 'Xu', 'Wu', 'Liu', 'Wu', 'Zhuang', 'Du', 'Li', 'Zhang', 'Legro', 'Chen']</td><td>2017</td><td>Human reproduction (Oxford, England)</td><td>Do oral contraceptives (OCs) and progestins impact live birth rate of IVF when used for cycle scheduling in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?</td><td>['Adult', 'Birth Rate', 'Contraceptives, Oral, Hormonal', 'Embryo Transfer', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Humans', 'Ovulation Induction', 'Polycystic Ovary Syndrome', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Progestins', 'Treatment Outcome']</td><td>['27172435', '25217611', '16936304', '16269449', '24885793', '27509101', '22525900', '393456', '27406348', '16895639', '18339377', '20091585', '26701802', '21737072', '26401593', '11420129', '27537097', '24842675', '24890274', '12660257', '27233760', '16253978', '25006718', '19631786', '6976442', '27261222', '20537631']</td></tr><tr><td>27999115</td><td>Transgender men's experiences of fertility preservation: a qualitative study.</td><td>['Armuand', 'Dhejne', 'Olofsson', 'Rodriguez-Wallberg']</td><td>2017</td><td>Human reproduction (Oxford, England)</td><td>How do transgender men experience fertility preservation (FP) by cryopreservation of oocytes?</td><td>['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Counseling', 'Cryopreservation', 'Female', 'Fertility Preservation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Men', 'Oocytes', 'Prospective Studies', 'Qualitative Research', 'Transgender Persons', 'Young Adult']</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>27999122</td><td>Moving target: transient rotational stenosis precipitating jugular bow hunter's syndrome.</td><td>['Brinjikji', 'Graffeo', 'Perry', 'Zimmerman', 'Janus', 'Morris', 'Cascino', 'Lanzino']</td><td>2016</td><td>BMJ case reports</td><td>A 60-year-old man presented with a 10-month history of of stereotypical spells characterized by vertigo, tinnitus, blurred vision, left hemibody numbness, and occasional syncope, precipitated by turning his head leftwards.

Understanding how diversity responds to environmental perturbations and the consequences of this relationship for ecosystem function are thus central challenges in microbial ecology. Unimodal diversity-disturbance relationships, in which maximum diversity occurs at intermediate levels of disturbance, have been predicted for ecosystems where life history tradeoffs separate organisms along a disturbance gradient. However, empirical support for such peaked relationships in macrosystems is mixed, and few studies have explored these relationships in microbial systems. Here we use complex microbial microcosm communities to systematically determine diversity-disturbance relationships over a range of disturbance regimes. We observed a reproducible switch between community states, which gave rise to transient diversity maxima when community states were forced to mix. Communities showed reduced compositional stability when diversity was highest. To further explore these dynamics, we formulated a simple model that reveals specific regimes under which diversity maxima are stable. Together, our results show how both unimodal and non-unimodal diversity-disturbance relationships can be observed as a system switches between two distinct microbial community states; this process likely occurs across a wide range of spatially and temporally heterogeneous microbial ecosystems.</td><td>['Biodiversity', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Microbial Consortia', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Ultraviolet Rays']</td><td>['10952310', '20520654', '26173701', '20224823', '24550501', '18375765', '18497287', '25730701', '23563954', '21233850', '25177538', '23487761', '11140680', '22402401', '26111582', '23953996', '17435792', '17586664', '25517225', '19914921', '20383131', '23267351', '17663718', '4998365', '4527752', '21422284', '22298854', '23575374', '16332807', '25157131', '27822539', '22972295', '11178938', '22606316', '16738658', '18811429', '22674335', '19270679', '22628097', '17840770', '22134646', '21048801', '24829564', '26185249', '19545266']</td></tr><tr><td>27999151</td><td>Collateral Damage: Detrimental Effect of Antibiotics on the Development of Protective Immune Memory.</td><td>['Benoun', 'Labuda', 'McSorley']</td><td>2016</td><td>mBio</td><td>Antibiotic intervention is an effective treatment strategy for many bacterial infections and liberates bacterial antigens and stimulatory products that can induce an inflammatory response. Despite the opportunity for bacterial killing to enhance the development of adaptive immunity, patients treated successfully with antibiotics can suffer from reinfection. Studies in mouse models of Salmonella and Chlamydia infection also demonstrate that early antibiotic intervention reduces host protective immunity to subsequent infection. This heightened susceptibility to reinfection correlates with poor development of Th1 and antibody responses in antibiotic-treated mice but can be overcome by delayed antibiotic intervention, thus suggesting a requirement for sustained T cell stimulation for protection. Although the contribution of memory T cell subsets is imperfectly understood in both of these infection models, a protective role for noncirculating memory cells is suggested by recent studies. Together, these data propose a model where antibiotic treatment specifically interrupts tissue-resident memory T cell formation. Greater understanding of the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon might suggest therapeutic interventions to restore a protective memory response in antibiotic-treated patients, thus reducing the incidence of reinfection.</td><td>['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibody Formation', 'Chlamydia Infections', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Mice', 'Recurrence', 'Salmonella Infections', 'Th1 Cells']</td><td>['20064446', '25071787', '26054866', '26099591', '20524236', '25992748', '19617871', '14734525', '10603367', '22517866', '21458583', '16235186', '20164434', '25789684', '25957682', '10603387', '23150714', '22431649', '21134485', '25126781', '16177105', '24639353', '15557161', '7591120', '11342598', '26180063', '15717266', '23470847', '23089550', '15273115', '3930625', '24408438', '24421044', '21307847', '25912288', '26646541', '21315116', '19494308', '22943883', '17979983', '18157065', '11755423', '26089520', '8617956', '9169723', '9120292', '23324973', '26787715', '25749454', '21884176', '21078844', '22934581', '15831840', '20133586', '10623848', '26092813', '22675215', '19521686', '10479155', '11244029', '24942689', '15496893', '3055168', '19542362', '9024098', '10816483', '23542740', '25383971', '24204262', '17583359', '20414145', '21214060', '11323695', '15897273', '21687759', '25170049', '6207248', '12456854', '16301662', '12244190']</td></tr><tr><td>27999152</td><td>25-Hydroxycholesterol Inhibition of Lassa Virus Infection through Aberrant GP1 Glycosylation.</td><td>['Shrivastava-Ranjan', 'Bergeron', 'Chakrabarti', 'Albariño', 'Flint', 'Nichol', 'Spiropoulou']</td><td>2016</td><td>mBio</td><td>Lassa virus (LASV) infection is a major public health concern due to high fatality rates and limited effective treatment. The interferon-stimulated gene cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). 25HC is involved in regulating cholesterol biosynthesis and has recently been identified as a potent antiviral targeting enveloped virus entry. Here, we show a previously unrecognized role of CH25H in inhibiting LASV glycoprotein glycosylation and the production of infectious virus. Overexpression of CH25H or treatment with 25HC decreased LASV G1 glycoprotein N-glycan maturation and reduced the production of infectious LASV. Depletion of endogenous CH25H using small interfering RNA (siRNA) enhanced the levels of fully glycosylated G1 and increased infectious LASV production. Finally, LASV particles produced from 25HC-treated cells were found to be less infectious, to incorporate aberrantly glycosylated GP1 species, and to be defective in binding alpha-dystroglycan, an attachment and entry receptor. Our findings identify a novel role for CH25H in controlling LASV propagation and indicate that manipulation of the expression of CH25H or the administration of 25HC may be a useful anti-LASV therapy.</td><td>['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Cell Line', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Hydroxycholesterols', 'Lassa virus', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Steroid Hydroxylases', 'Viral Envelope Proteins', 'Virus Internalization', 'Virus Replication']</td><td>['23273843', '24994901', '2541446', '23202458', '14990737', '19321606', '24699674', '2141203', '3896128', '25501851', '16737539', '21056893', '22357276', '9604938', '11606739', '3940312', '20980515', '23601107', '25999047', '14644972', '916963', '17412988', '10888638', '19846507', '25986249', '15857984', '23273844', '25903345', '17378212', '9851928']</td></tr><tr><td>27999153</td><td>Networked Chemoreceptors Benefit Bacterial Chemotaxis Performance.</td><td>['Frank', 'Piñas', 'Cohen', 'Parkinson', 'Vaknin']</td><td>2016</td><td>mBio</td><td>Motile bacteria use large receptor arrays to detect and follow chemical gradients in their environment.

Subjects cured by autologous FMT typically had greater abundances of the Clostridium XIVa clade and Holdemania bacteria prior to treatment, and the relative abundances of these groups increased significantly after FMT compared to heterologous FMT and pre-FMT samples. The typical shift to post-FMT, donor-like assemblages, featuring high relative abundances of genera within the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla, was not observed in the autologous FMT subjects. Autologous FMT patient bacterial communities were significantly different in composition than those for heterologous FMT patients and donors (P < 0.001). The SourceTracker program, which employs a Bayesian algorithm to determine source contributions to sink communities, showed that patients initially treated by heterologous FMT had significantly higher percentages of engraftment (i.e., similarity to donor communities, mean value of 74%) compared to those who suffered recurrence following autologous FMT (1%) (P ≤ 0.013).

Engagement of Fc receptors on basophils and mast cells can either activate these cells, which promotes autoimmune and allergic inflammation, or prevent these cells from being activated. Whether these cells are activated depends upon which Fc receptors are present in clusters, because some Fc receptors can inhibit signaling by other Fc receptors that are present in the same signalosome, a phenomenon known as cis-inhibition. Malbec et al. identified a mechanism whereby inhibitory Fc receptors limit signaling by activating Fc receptors without being present in the same signalosome. This mechanism of trans-inhibition also allowed inhibitory Fc receptors to limit signaling by growth factor receptors in mast cells and oncogene-induced proliferation in mastocytoma cells.Listen to Podcast.</td><td>['Animals', 'Basophils', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Mast Cells', 'Mastocytoma', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Oncogenes', 'Receptors, Fc']</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>27999165</td><td>Rac signal adaptation controls neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow.</td><td>['Campa', 'Germena', 'Ciraolo', 'Copperi', 'Sapienza', 'Franco', 'Ghigo', 'Camporeale', 'Di Savino', 'Martini', 'Perino', 'Megens', 'Kurz', 'Scheiermann', 'Sperandio', 'Gamba', 'Hirsch']</td><td>2016</td><td>Science signaling</td><td>Mobilization of neutrophils from the bone marrow determines neutrophil blood counts and thus is medically important. Balanced neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow depends on the retention-promoting chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 and the egression-promoting chemokine CXCL2 and its receptor CXCR2. Both pathways activate the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac, leaving the role of this signaling event in neutrophil retention and egression ambiguous. On the assumption that active Rac determines persistent directional cell migration, we generated a mathematical model to link chemokine-mediated Rac modulation to neutrophil egression time. Our computer simulation indicated that, in the bone marrow, where the retention signal predominated, egression time strictly depended on the time it took Rac to return to its basal activity (namely, adaptation). This prediction was validated in mice lacking the Rac inhibitor ArhGAP15. Neutrophils in these mice showed prolonged Rac adaptation and cell-autonomous retention in the bone marrow. Our model thus demonstrates that mobilization in the presence of two spatially defined opposing chemotactic cues strictly depends on inhibitors shaping the time course of signal adaptation. Furthermore, our findings might help to find new modes of intervention to treat conditions characterized by excessively low or high circulating neutrophils.</td><td>['Animals', 'Bone Marrow', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neutrophils', 'Receptors, CXCR4', 'Signal Transduction', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins']</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>27999166</td><td>The histone deubiquitinase OTLD1 targets euchromatin to regulate plant growth.</td><td>['Keren', 'Citovsky']</td><td>2016</td><td>Science signaling</td><td>Histone monoubiquitination is associated with active chromatin and plays an important role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression in plants.

Furthermore, UBP26 is the only plant histone deubiquitinase for which the functional role has been characterized in detail. We used gain- and loss-of-function alleles of OTLD1 to examine its role in the plant life cycle and showed that OTLD1 stimulates plant growth, increases cell size, and induces transcriptional repression of five major regulators of plant organ growth and development: GA20OX, WUS, OSR2, ARL, and ABI5 OTLD1 associated with chromatin at each of these target genes and promoted the removal of euchromatic histone acetylation, ubiquitination, and methylation marks.

Diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGKζ) converts DAG into phosphatidic acid (PA). Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) from mice deficient in DGKζ have enhanced antiviral and antitumor activities, indicating that the amount of DAG controls the effectiveness of the T cell response. We characterized the second C1 domain of protein kinase Cθ (PKCθ), a DAG-binding protein that is specifically recruited to the IS, as a biological sensor to observe the generation of a DAG gradient during IS formation. In experiments with transgenic mouse CTLs expressing the OT-I T cell receptor (TCR), we showed that both strong and weak interactions between antigen and the TCR led to the rapid generation of DAG, whereas only strong interactions induced the movement of DAG-enriched organelles toward the IS. In DGKζ-deficient CTLs, antigen stimulation led to the enhanced accumulation of DAG-containing organelles at the IS; however, impaired activation of the PA effector PKCζ resulted in lack of reorientation of the microtubule-organizing center toward the IS, a process needed for effective T cell activation. Together, these data suggest that the activation of DGKζ downstream of antigen recognition provides a mechanism that ensures the activation of PA-dependent signaling as a direct result of the strength of TCR-dependent DAG mobilization.</td><td>['Animals', 'Diacylglycerol Kinase', 'Diglycerides', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Immunological Synapses', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Organelles', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell', 'T-Lymphocytes']</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>27999169</td><td>Modifications to a LATE MERISTEM IDENTITY1 gene are responsible for the major leaf shapes of Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.).</td><td>['Andres', 'Coneva', 'Frank', 'Tuttle', 'Samayoa', 'Han', 'Kaur', 'Zhu', 'Fang', 'Bowman', 'Rojas-Pierce', 'Haigler', 'Jones', 'Holland', 'Chitwood', 'Kuraparthy']</td><td>2017</td><td>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</td><td>1 locus.

Insights into many other condensed matter phenomena have come from colloidal systems, whose micron-scale particles mimic basic properties of atoms and molecules but permit dynamic visualization with single-particle resolution. Recently, experiments showed that bidisperse mixtures of filamentous viruses can self-assemble into colloidal monolayers with thermodynamically stable rafts exhibiting chiral structure and repulsive interactions. We quantitatively explain these observations by modeling the membrane particles as chiral liquid crystals.

Although this system is composed of filamentous viruses whose aggregation is entropically driven by dextran depletants instead of phospholipids and cholesterol with prominent electrostatic interactions, colloidal and biological membranes share many of the same physical symmetries.

This process is mediated by the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in many tumors. This paradigm has led to the development of specific therapeutic approaches targeting VEGF or its receptors.

We hypothesized that the existence of anti-angiogenic forms of VEGF VEGFxxxb which are still present in many tumors limit the therapeutic effects of the anti-VEGF antibodies bevacizumab/Avastin (BVZ). To test this hypothesis, we generated renal cell carcinoma cells (RCC) expressing VEGF165b. The incidence of tumors xenografts generated in nude mice and their growth were inferior to those obtained with control cells. Whereas BVZ had no effect on control tumors, it slowed-down the growth of tumor generated with VEGF165b expressing cells. A prophylactic immunization against the domain discriminating VEGF from VEGFxxxb isoforms inhibited the growth of tumor generated with two different syngenic tumor cell lines (melanoma (B16 cells) and RCC (RENCA cells)). Purified immunoglobulins from immunized mice also slowed-down tumor growth of human RCC xenografts in nude mice, producing a potent effect compared to BVZ in this model. Furthermore, down-regulating the serine-arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) or masking SRSF1 binding sites by 2'O-Methyl RNA resulted in the increase of the VEGFxxxb/VEGF ratio. Therefore, a vaccine approach, specific antibodies against pro-angiogenic forms of VEGF, or increasing the VEGFxxxb/VEGF ratio may represent new prophylactic or pro-active anti-cancer strategies.</td><td>['Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Bevacizumab', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms', 'Melanoma, Experimental', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Neoplasms', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']</td><td>['20822802', '19249681', '25010863', '18978936', '17855506', '18923433', '17310252', '15175435', '20031229', '26312386', '17876014', '16920734', '19034678', '21757334', '23104894', '19417570', '18948057', '18843117', '23761094', '23658612', '647684', '23149898', '20512124', '19249680', '23887803', '25381816', '18160686', '24335961', '22172722', '18156031', '20368553', '21126687', '17301234', '24676409', '26419779', '18349829', '8576250', '18579287', '27791128', '27872951', '12124351', '21909141', '22894670', '21194429', '17167137']</td></tr><tr><td>27999180</td><td>The prognostic value of node status in different breast cancer subtypes.</td><td>['Yang', 'Yu', 'Hou', 'Chi', 'Ge', 'Wang', 'Cao']</td><td>2017</td><td>Oncotarget</td><td>Nodal metastases and breast cancer subtypes (BCS) are both well-recognized prognostic indicators.

However, expression of mesenchymal markers, which promote fibrosis in various organs, has not been characterized in the diabetic retina.

High glucose conditions increased mesenchymal maker expression and migration in Müller cells. Snail, N-cadherin, Vimentin, β-catenin, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) levels were all dramatically increased in retinas from humans with diabetic retinopathy (DR) and from DR mouse models. In addition, Snail overexpression increased the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and fibronectin, while Snail knockdown attenuated high glucose-induced increases in fibronectin and CTGF expression. These results demonstrate for the first time that mesenchymal markers are upregulated in retinas from a diabetic mouse model, and that Snail and N-cadherin levels are also increased in Müller cells exposed to high glucose.

PC incidence and prognosis are affected by obesity, a pandemic characterized by high levels of leptin. Notch is upregulated by leptin in breast cancer. Thus, leptin and Notch crosstalk could influence PC progression. Here we investigated in PC cell lines (BxPC-3, MiaPaCa-2, Panc-1, AsPC-1), derived tumorspheres and xenografts whether a functional leptin-Notch axis affects PC progression and expansion of pancreatic cancer stem cells (PCSC). PC cells and tumorspheres were treated with leptin and inhibitors of Notch (gamma-secretase inhibitor, DAPT) and leptin (iron oxide nanoparticle-leptin peptide receptor antagonist 2, IONP-LPrA2). Leptin treatment increased cell cycle progression and proliferation, and the expression of Notch receptors, ligands and targeted molecules (Notch1-4, DLL4, JAG1, Survivin and Hey2), PCSC markers (CD24/CD44/ESA, ALDH, CD133, Oct-4), ABCB1 protein, as well as tumorsphere formation. Leptin-induced effects on PC and tumorspheres were decreased by IONP-LPrA2 and DAPT. PC cells secreted leptin and expressed the leptin receptor, OB-R, which indicates a leptin autocrine/paracrine signaling loop could also affect tumor progression. IONP-LPrA2 treatment delayed the onset of MiaPaCa-2 xenografts, and decreased tumor growth and the expression of proliferation and PCSC markers. Present data suggest that leptin-Notch axis is involved in PC. PC has no targeted therapy and is mainly treated with chemotherapy, whose efficiency could be decreased by leptin and Notch activities. Thus, the leptin-Notch axis could be a novel therapeutic target, particularly for obese PC patients.</td><td>['Animals', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leptin', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Receptors, Notch', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors']</td><td>['20600632', '23200678', '24069258', '20725998', '12711737', '17283135', '7984236', '25170203', '19584158', '24145341', '25948792', '24122412', '19028876', '23622135', '24647545', '25266049', '21508972', '23545339', '25976079', '27246539', '23226563', '19628082', '24605024', '21193018', '24114531', '19289659', '16825198', '19531256', '23562747', '12897384', '12943810', '22083089', '20814421', '23872274', '19648918', '12842085', '26085045', '27019796', '21731759', '23402814', '26862489', '23124118', '25919692', '19258443']</td></tr><tr><td>27999183</td><td>NHERF1 regulates the progression of colorectal cancer through the interplay with VEGFR2 pathway.</td><td>['Gu', 'Yu', 'Hao', 'Martin', 'Hargest', 'He', 'Cheng', 'Jiang']</td><td>2017</td><td>Oncotarget</td><td>The oncogenic role of ectopic expression of Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) was recently suggested in colorectal cancer, where it was implicated in playing a role in the tumor hypoxia microenvironment.

The prognostic value of VEGFR2 expression in colorectal cancer relied on the expression of NHERF1. The up-regulation of NHERF1 induced by the exposure to hypoxia in colon cancer cells depended on the activation of VEGFR2 signaling. NHERF1 in turn inhibited the activation of VEGFR2 signaling which could be regulated by the interaction between NHERF1 and VEGFR2, resulting in the reduction of migration and invasion of colon cancer cells.

In conclusion, our results suggest that JNJ-26854165, used either alone or in combination with TKIs, represents a promising novel targeted approach to overcome TKI resistance and improve patient outcome in CML.</td><td>['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proteolysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Time Factors', 'Tryptamines', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']</td><td>['19047139', '20975744', '12499247', '20525993', '10866298', '10481009', '18827185', '16286244', '21490338', '20736344', '21481795', '23415012', '24180494', '15618470', '11882364', '21118980', '17213283', '20378778', '21922647', '12941844', '19240172', '16527898', '21946665', '14996839', '12620409', '16953242', '16651519', '14704432', '2068108', '22407228', '21350558', '19819619', '21504625', '21831953', '24040331', '11423618', '1967214', '20094798', '20525995', '23458731', '23999433', '17151364', '18519952', '23238683', '21248063', '11756187', '19064740', '21632458', '23303139']</td></tr><tr><td>27999186</td><td>Radiation-induced SOD2 overexpression sensitizes colorectal cancer to radiation while protecting normal tissue.</td><td>['Zhang', 'Lang', 'Cao', 'Li', 'Wang', 'Wang']</td><td>2017</td><td>Oncotarget</td><td>This study investigated whether radiation-induced overexpression of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) exerts radio-sensitizing effects on tumor cells while having radio-protective effects on normal cells during radio-activated gene therapy for human colorectal cancer.

Moreover, meiosis was initiated in CHIR99021 and retinoic acid co-treated cultures as evidenced by a significant expression of the punctate synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SCP3). Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis indicated that a small percentage of putative 1N populations were formed. Mechanically, we found that β-catenin relocated into nucleus after the treatment of 3 d CHIR99021 suggesting that Wnt signaling pathway was activated. Furthermore, blockade of Wnt signaling pathway by IWR-1 can reverse CHIR99021 and retinoic acid mediated-effects.

We found that lipopolysaccharide exposure significantly decreased the first polar body extrusion rate and delayed the cell cycle progression. The abnormal spindle rate was significantly increased in lipopolysaccharide treatment group, accompanied by disrupted localization and level of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-MAPK). Moreover, lipopolysaccharide treatment significantly increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and the early apoptotic rate in oocytes. The pro-apoptotic caspase-3 and Bax mRNA levels and caspase-3 protein level were significantly increased, whereas the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and XIAP transcript abundance were significantly decreased in lipopolysaccharide exposure group. Furthermore, the dimethyl-histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2) level was significantly increased, while the DNA methylation (5-mC) and dimethyl-histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) levels were markedly decreased in oocytes treated with lipopolysaccharide.

It is known to have a poor prognosis, mostly because early stages of the disease are generally asymptomatic. Progress in pancreatic cancer research has been slow, leaving several fundamental questions pertaining to diagnosis and treatment unanswered. Recent studies highlight the putative utility of tissue-specific vesicles (i.e. extracellular vesicles) in the diagnosis of disease onset and treatment monitoring in pancreatic cancer. Extracellular vesicles are membrane-limited structures derived from the cell membrane. They contain specific molecules including proteins, mRNA, microRNAs and non-coding RNAs that are secreted in the extracellular space. Extracellular vesicles can be classified according to their size and/or origin into microvesicles (~150-1000 nm) and exosomes (~40-120 nm). Microvesicles are released by budding from the plasmatic membrane, whereas exosomes are released via the endocytic pathway by fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasmatic membrane. This endosomal origin means that exosomes contain an abundance of cell-specific biomolecules which may act as a 'fingerprint' of the cell of origin. In this review, we discuss our current knowledge in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer, particularly the potential role of EVs in these facets of disease management. In particular, we suggest that as exosomes contain cellular protein and RNA molecules in a cell type-specific manner, they may provide extensive information about the signature of the tumour and pancreatic cancer progression.</td><td>['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Biopsy', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles', 'Disease Progression', 'Exosomes', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']</td><td>['23338841', '11988769', '19405120', '24009894', '26909131', '24965404', '22103617', '25104112', '17097848', '24624263', '24952243', '26861306', '25428385', '25820723', '25391424', '17486113', '18228490', '15958569', '22878649', '20187793', '24007214', '24218614', '22753494', '23498743', '22821831', '27838931', '19260747', '18656897', '26337469', '26195069', '11102889', '25501287', '24937521', '16717472', '21763319', '26394703', '23479506', '25544774', '25985394', '16246688', '15211117', '23161513', '23377965', '26819679', '27267843', '27572129', '15224285', '26194179', '27698786', '22194634', '9001347', '19627513', '25469109', '18819103', '23622133', '26851397', '25388097', '20126692', '26106858', '25336151', '22427800', '19794968', '24398677', '24486645', '17219198', '24722878', '25288114', '18695761', '26920219', '24683445', '25536934', '21098712', '27010960', '23709120', '22415469']</td></tr><tr><td>27999191</td><td>Rottlerin exhibits antitumor activity via down-regulation of TAZ in non-small cell lung cancer.</td><td>['Zhao', 'Zheng', 'Wang', 'Hou', 'Zhou', 'Wang']</td><td>2017</td><td>Oncotarget</td><td>Rottlerin, a polyphenolic compound derived from Mallotus philipinensis, has been reported to exhibit anti-tumor activities in a variety of human malignancies including NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer).

Therefore, inhibition of TAZ could be useful for the treatment of human cancers. In the current study, we aimed to explore whether rottlerin inhibits the expression of TAZ in NSCLC, leading to its anti-cancer activity. Multiple approaches were applied for determining the mechanism of rottlerin-mediated anti-tumor function, including cell growth assay, Flow cytometry, wound healing assay, invasion assay, Western blotting, and transfection. We found that rottlerin inhibited cell growth, triggered apoptosis, arrested cell cycle, and retarded cell invasion in NSCLC cells. Moreover, our results showed that overexpression of TAZ enhanced cell growth, stimulated apoptosis, and promoted cell migration and invasion. Consistently, inhibition of TAZ exhibited anti-tumor activity in NSCLC cells. Notably, we validated that rottlerin exerted its tumor suppressive function via inactivation of TAZ in NSCLC cells.

We studied Mep1A regulation by Reptin, its role in HCC, and whether it mediates Reptin oncogenic effects.MepA and Reptin expression was measured in human HCC by qRT-PCR and in cultured cells by PCR, western blot and enzymatic activity measurements. Cell growth was assessed by counting and MTS assay. Cell migration was measured in Boyden chambers and wound healing assays, and cell invasion in Boyden chambers.Silencing Reptin decreased Mep1A expression and activity, without affecting meprin β. Mep1A, but not meprin β, was overexpressed in a series of 242 human HCC (2.04 fold, p < 0.0001), and a high expression correlated with a poor prognosis. Mep1A and Reptin expressions were positively correlated (r = 0.39, p < 0.0001). Silencing Mep1A had little effect on cell proliferation, but decreased cell migration and invasion of HuH7 and Hep3B cells. Conversely, overexpression of Mep1A or addition of recombinant Mep1A increased migration and invasion. Finally, overexpression of Mep1A restored a normal cell migration in cells where Reptin was depleted.Mep1A is overexpressed in most HCC and induces HCC cell migration and invasion. Mep1A expression is regulated by Reptin, and Mep1A mediates Reptin-induced migration.

However, studies on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients are relatively scarce. The current population-based study aimed to investigate the distinct outcomes between BCS+RT and mastectomy in patients with TNBC. Utilizing the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we enrolled 11,514 female TNBC cases diagnosed during the years 2010-2013. Those patients were subdivided into BCS+RT (5,469) and mastectomy groups (6,045), and we conducted a survival comparison between the two groups. The endpoints were breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS). In the overall cohort, patients with BCS+RT exhibited distinctly better breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) (log-rank, p < 0.001) and overall survival (OS) (log-rank, p < 0.001) than did mastectomy patients. When stratifying the TNBC patients according to age, histology grade, TNM stage, tumor size, and lymph node (LN) status, most patients in the BCS+RT group presented with better survival than did the patients in the mastectomy group, except for the grade I (log-rank, p = 0.830, both BCSS and OS) and stage I (log-rank, BCSS, p = 0.127; OS, p = 0.093) patients. In addition, after adjusting for confounding variables by multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis, BCS+RT still tended to present with higher BCSS and OS. In conclusion, from our study on SEER data, BCS+RT displayed elevated BCSS and OS in TNBC patients compared to mastectomy, at least equally. Our study provided further evidence for surgeons that BCS with RT is available for TNBC patients.</td><td>['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Mastectomy, Modified Radical', 'Mastectomy, Segmental', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'SEER Program', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms', 'Young Adult']</td><td>['22373563', '22113254', '24704845', '10635334', '27393621', '23012306', '25858148', '26479066', '18713980', '20702548', '12393820', '21947595', '27344114', '3883167', '22754758', '26886584', '12393819', '19706802', '25071979', '18465335', '24894343', '21670451', '26018878']</td></tr><tr><td>27999194</td><td>LncRNA16 is a potential biomarker for diagnosis of early-stage lung cancer that promotes cell proliferation by regulating the cell cycle.</td><td>['Zhu', 'Zhang', 'Yan', 'Li', 'Cui', 'Zhu', 'Xia', 'Yang', 'Yuan', 'Chen', 'Luo', 'Chen', 'Xing', 'Lu', 'Wu']</td><td>2017</td><td>Oncotarget</td><td>Early diagnosis of lung cancer greatly reduces mortality; however, the lack of suitable plasma biomarkers presents a major obstacle. Recent studies showed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) played important roles in cancer initiation and development. Here, we identified differentially expressed lncRNAs in 20 lung cancer samples by using custom designed microarray and evaluated their expression in 118 lung cancer samples by real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). lncRNA16 (ENST00000539303) expression was significantly higher in lung cancer tissues (80/118) than in adjacent matched normal tissues. Importantly, this increase was similar to that in plasma (53/84) of lung cancer patients, including early stage. The role of lncRNA16 in lung cancer was studied in vitro and in vivo by using the lung cancer cell lines and xenograft mouse models. The results reveal that knockdown of lncRNA16 inhibited proliferation of PC9 cells in vitro and also inhibited tumor growth in xenograft mouse models. Overexpression of lncRNA16 promoted proliferation of A549 cells in vitro and also promoted tumor growth in xenograft mouse models. Specifically, we showed that lncRNA16 promoted G2/M transition by regulating cyclin B1 transcription. Together, our findings suggest that lncRNA16 is a promising biomarker suitable for early diagnosis of lung cancer, and a potential target for lung cancer treatment.</td><td>['A549 Cells', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell-Free Nucleic Acids', 'Cyclin B1', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']</td><td>['21483235', '23762823', '10762622', '10051609', '17241883', '19483093', '15208674', '25391424', '18836484', '22153832', '23696037', '7997877', '24114970', '19632938', '22088988', '21303969', '11895914', '20647400', '25597199', '20179190', '2683079', '24504682', '22781412', '19968870', '7687515', '25636452', '25120813', '26812883', '24313945', '21296855', '10676633', '20660959', '23201468', '19239885', '22954172', '22610500', '12970751']</td></tr><tr><td>27999195</td><td>Serine protease inhibitor kazal-type 6 inhibits tumorigenesis of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells via its extracellular action.</td><td>['Ge', 'Huang', 'Wang', 'Gu', 'Dai', 'Xu', 'Wu', 'Li', 'Lu', 'Zhong', 'Huang']</td><td>2017</td><td>Oncotarget</td><td>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) causes significant medical burdens worldwide. Diagnosis, especially in the early stages, is still challenging. Therapeutic options are limited and often ineffective. Although several risk factors have been known important for development of HCC, the molecular basis of the process is rather complex and has not been fully understood. We have found that a subpopulation of HCC cells which are resistant to oncolytic parvovirus H1 superinfection highly express serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 6 (SPINK6). This protein is specifically reduced in all HCC cell lines and tissues we analyzed. When upregulated, SPINK6 could suppress the malignant phenotypes of the HCC cells in several in vitro models. The putative tumor suppression role of SPINK6 is, however, independent of its protease inhibitory activity. To suppress the malignancy of HCC cells, SPINK6 has to be secreted to trigger signals which regulate an intracellular signaling molecule, ERK1/2, as well as a series of downstream factors involved in cell cycle progression, apoptosis and migration. Our study supports that SPINK6 is an important tumor suppressor in liver, and further investigations may help develop more effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.</td><td>['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Serine Peptidase Inhibitors, Kazal Type']</td><td>['21439340', '19887546', '17629406', '24096476', '23988000', '25707355', '19565332', '23728999', '20059340', '20667819', '19773433', '16316394', '22212898', '9858526', '21837240', '19331697', '25954743', '8378352', '19585652', '23303447', '11332986', '24352040', '18197790', '15922292', '15634685', '18333158', '19383303', '18845355', '11318977', '18829156', '21992124', '17287256', '22172719']</td></tr><tr><td>27999196</td><td>Mesothelin-targeted immunotoxin RG7787 has synergistic anti-tumor activity when combined with taxanes.</td><td>['Kolyvas', 'Rudloff', 'Poruchynsky', 'Landsman', 'Hollevoet', 'Venzon', 'Alewine']</td><td>2017</td><td>Oncotarget</td><td>Recombinant immunotoxins (RITs) are antibody-based therapeutics that carry a toxin payload. The RG7787 RIT targets the cancer antigen mesothelin to deliver a recombinantly-engineered, reduced immunogenicity variant of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) to the cytosol where it inhibits protein synthesis. Here we demonstrate that maximal doses of RG7787 temporarily halt growth of pancreatic cancer tumor xenografts, similar to the approved drugs gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, however, combination of the RIT with nab-paclitaxel produces durable complete regressions in most mice. Synergy between taxane and anti-MSLN RITs has been previously demonstrated in mouse models, but direct interaction of the combination in cell culture was not observed. Here, we show that this favorable interaction occurs in cell culture, is dependent on the dose and duration of RG7787 exposure, requires the catalytically active PE, and still occurs with RIT targeting a non-MSLN surface antigen. Unexpectedly, the combination does not increase RG7787-mediated protein synthesis inhibition nor perturb downstream apoptotic markers of RIT-mediated killing, but does augment levels of acetylated tubulin, a marker of taxane activity. Taken together, these data suggest that PE increases cell sensitivity to taxane-mediated killing by increasing taxane-mediated microtubule stability and priming cells for apoptosis by decreasing levels of the pro-survival factor Mcl-1.</td><td>['Acetylation', 'Albumins', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Paclitaxel', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms', 'Time Factors', 'Tubulin', 'Tubulin Modulators', 'Tumor Burden', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']</td><td>['22351743', '22787150', '20103626', '25213191', '19671873', '17940013', '14970517', '24131140', '17785569', '26111884', '24670687', '27507537', '11751476', '22869130', '16899620', '25561510', '20457813', '22753489', '25239937', '18656424', '18974392', '24824231', '18451153', '10733593', '24928849', '16416732', '18403491', '16697956']</td></tr><tr><td>27999197</td><td>MutY-Homolog (MYH) inhibition reduces pancreatic cancer cell growth and increases chemosensitivity.</td><td>['Sharbeen', 'Youkhana', 'Mawson', 'McCarroll', 'Nunez', 'Biankin', 'Johns', 'Goldstein', 'Phillips']</td><td>2017</td><td>Oncotarget</td><td>Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PC) have a poor prognosis due to metastases and chemoresistance. PC is characterized by extensive fibrosis, which creates a hypoxic microenvironment, and leads to increased chemoresistance and intracellular oxidative stress. Thus, proteins that protect against oxidative stress are potential therapeutic targets for PC. A key protein that maintains genomic integrity against oxidative damage is MutY-Homolog (MYH). No prior studies have investigated the function of MYH in PC cells. Using siRNA, we showed that knockdown of MYH in PC cells 1) reduced PC cell proliferation and increased apoptosis; 2) further decreased PC cell growth in the presence of oxidative stress and chemotherapy agents (gemcitabine, paclitaxel and vincristine); 3) reduced PC cell metastatic potential; and 4) decreased PC tumor growth in a subcutaneous mouse model in vivo. The results from this study suggest MYH may be a novel therapeutic target for PC that could potentially improve patient outcome by reducing PC cell survival, increasing the efficacy of existing drugs and reducing metastatic spread.</td><td>['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptosis', 'Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Glycosylases', 'Deoxycytidine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Paclitaxel', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Hypoxia', 'Tumor Microenvironment', 'Vincristine', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']</td><td>['11433026', '24643704', '22505926', '12832285', '20427809', '23611705', '24695225', '24695224', '23856911', '25988138', '24071366', '18791199', '25448488', '1730583', '16857720', '27305597', '23376776', '10684930', '17638869', '21620466', '23450852', '25544769', '15523100', '25310643', '22252118', '25719666', '17909050', '26063178', '19460998', '15199168', '20567622', '24478715', '11801590', '27253694', '19820168', '21615992', '26742998', '24782785', '24315136']</td></tr><tr><td>27999198</td><td>Clinicopathological and prognostic significance of COX-2 immunohistochemical expression in breast cancer: a meta-analysis.</td><td>['Xu', 'Li', 'Zhang', 'Cui', 'Liu', 'Li', 'Jiang']</td><td>2017</td><td>Oncotarget</td><td>The prognostic significance of COX-2 in patients with breast cancer remains controversial.

Our findings suggest that 14-3-3 σ promoter methylation may be associated with the carcinogenesis of breast cancer and that the use of 14-3-3 σ promoter methylation might represent a useful blood-based biomarker for the clinical diagnosis of breast cancer.</td><td>['14-3-3 Proteins', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Circulating Tumor DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Exoribonucleases', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Odds Ratio', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'ROC Curve', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']</td><td>['22744714', '25333850', '10811911', '27351130', '26392073', '27659069', '11423985', '23737396', '26629316', '17549626', '22615811', '27305625', '27304597', '19349478', '19642975', '19961842', '15272579', '21221769', '25458226', '15489902', '19160382', '25421659', '17264521', '25041782', '27566576', '25651787', '23326810', '24258259', '1143310', '25622259', '2039707', '27036965', '10802937', '19685192', '10524633', '8412556', '15620907', '26562238', '26918343', '11077447', '27636552', '18784433', '16106022', '25754026', '15257317', '9382404', '27635263']</td></tr><tr><td>27999201</td><td>S4S8-RPA phosphorylation as an indicator of cancer progression in oral squamous cell carcinomas.</td><td>['Rector', 'Kapil', 'Treude', 'Kumm', 'Glanzer', 'Byrne', 'Liu', 'Smith', 'DiMaio', 'Giannini', 'Smith', 'Oakley']</td><td>2017</td><td>Oncotarget</td><td>Oral cancers are easily accessible compared to many other cancers. Nevertheless, oral cancer is often diagnosed late, resulting in a poor prognosis. Most oral cancers are squamous cell carcinomas that predominantly develop from cell hyperplasias and dysplasias. DNA damage is induced in these tissues directly or indirectly in response to oncogene-induced deregulation of cellular proliferation. Consequently, a DNA Damage response (DDR) and a cell cycle checkpoint is activated. As dysplasia transitions to cancer, proteins involved in DNA damage and checkpoint signaling are mutated or silenced decreasing cell death while increasing genomic instability and allowing continued tumor progression. Hyperphosphorylation of Replication Protein A (RPA), including phosphorylation of Ser4 and Ser8 of RPA2, is a well-known indicator of DNA damage and checkpoint activation. In this study, we utilize S4S8-RPA phosphorylation as a marker for cancer development and progression in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC). S4S8-RPA phosphorylation was observed to be low in normal cells, high in dysplasias, moderate in early grade tumors, and low in late stage tumors, essentially supporting the model of the DDR as an early barrier to tumorigenesis in certain types of cancers. In contrast, overall RPA expression was not correlative to DDR activation or tumor progression. Utilizing S4S8-RPA phosphorylation to indicate competent DDR activation in the future may have clinical significance in OSCC treatment decisions, by predicting the susceptibility of cancer cells to first-line platinum-based therapies for locally advanced, metastatic and recurrent OSCC.</td><td>['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Mouth Neoplasms', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Phosphorylation', 'Replication Protein A', 'Serine', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors']</td><td>['20932174', '19843584', '15829956', '21278446', '20947357', '15279788', '23380594', '18594563', '15279793', '18323444', '16523492', '17303408', '9295339', '22945645', '21798897', '19787780', '23813586', '22977173', '24819595', '25616580', '20515732', '17136093']</td></tr><tr><td>27999202</td><td>LY3009120, a panRAF inhibitor, has significant anti-tumor activity in BRAF and KRAS mutant preclinical models of colorectal cancer.</td><td>['Vakana', 'Pratt', 'Blosser', 'Dowless', 'Simpson', 'Yuan', 'Jaken', 'Manro', 'Stephens', 'Zhang', 'Huber', 'Peng', 'Stancato']</td><td>2017</td><td>Oncotarget</td><td>Activating mutations in the KRAS and BRAF genes, leading to hyperactivation of the RAS/RAF/MAPK oncogenic signaling cascade, are common in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). While selective BRAF inhibitors are efficacious in BRAFmut melanoma, they have limited efficacy in BRAFmut CRC patients. In a RASmut background, selective BRAF inhibitors are contraindicated due to paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway through potentiation of CRAF kinase activity. A way to overcome such paradoxical activation is through concurrent inhibition of the kinase activity of both RAF isoforms. Here, we further examined the effects of LY3009120, a panRAF and RAF dimer inhibitor, in human models of CRC with various mutational backgrounds. We demonstrate that LY3009120 induced anti-proliferative effects in BRAFmut and KRASmut CRC cell lines through G1-cell cycle arrest. The anti-proliferative effects of LY3009120 in KRASmut CRC cell lines phenocopied molecular inhibition of RAF isoforms by simultaneous siRNA-mediated knockdown of ARAF, BRAF and CRAF. Additionally, LY3009120 displayed significant activity in in vivo BRAFmut and KRASmut CRC xenograft models. Examination of potential resistance to LY3009120 demonstrated RAF-independent ERK and AKT activation in the KRASmut CRC cell line HCT 116.

We retrospectively reviewed 922 consecutive patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients administered with gefitinib/erlotinib at Guangdong General Hospital. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were analyzed respectively. In total, 66 EGFR-mutant patients with stage IV adenocarcinoma were eligible, of whom 51 underwent re-biopsy upon initial progression. Among them, 18 (35.3%) harbored T790M mutation. No statistical significant differences were seen between T790M-positive and T790M-negative patients in PFS, OS, ORR or DCR. The median PFS, median OS, ORR, and DCR of the overall 66 patients were 2.0 months, 6.8 months, 6.1% and 39.4%, respectively. Good performance status (PS) was found to be independent favorable prognostic factor and long TKI-free interval to be associated with superior PFS. In conclusion, T790M mutation might not predict the clinical outcomes in first-generation EGFR-TKI re-challenge. Based on the poor efficacy from our data, re-challenge of first-generation EGFR-TKIs could not be recommended routinely, but for those with good PS and long TKI-free interval, it might be an alternative option.</td><td>['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung', 'Erlotinib Hydrochloride', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Quinazolines', 'Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']</td><td>['19692684', '21788562', '26958497', '21194487', '21784628', '22215752', '21529987', '21233402', '22333554', '22285168', '23470965', '21135146', '25405807', '22142557', '18644828', '25923549', '17577030', '20022809', '21783417', '21430269', '18981003', '19692680', '24018023']</td></tr><tr><td>27999204</td><td>MicroRNAs as regulators and mediators of forkhead box transcription factors function in human cancers.</td><td>['Li', 'Zhang', 'Chen', 'Chen', 'Wang', 'Chu']</td><td>2017</td><td>Oncotarget</td><td>Evidence has shown that microRNAs are widely implicated as indispensable components of tumor suppressive and oncogenic pathways in human cancers.

Analyses of partial nucleotide sequences of five domains of the CSDaV genomic RNA, including those encoding for the methyltransferase, the multi-domain region (MDR), the helicase, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the coat protein, showed that the MDR coding region was the most diverse region assessed here, and a possible association between this region and virus adaption to different host or plant tissues is considered. Overall, the nucleotide diversity (π) was low for CSDaV isolates, but the phylogenetic analyses revealed the predominance of two main groups, one of which showed a higher association with CSD-symptomatic plants. Isolates obtained from CSD-symptomatic plants, compared to those obtained from asymptomatic plants, showed higher nucleotide diversity, nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates and number of amino acid changes on the coding regions located closer to the 5' end region of the genomic RNA.

Currently, it is assessed by physicians or health professionals mainly by means of a patient-reported questionnaire, sometimes combined with the therapist's judgment on performance-based tasks. This work introduces an approach to assess the activity capacity at home in a more objective, yet interpretable way. It offers a pilot study on 28 patients suffering from axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) to demonstrate its efficacy. Firstly, a protocol is introduced to recognize a limited set of six transition activities in the home environment using a single accelerometer. To this end, a hierarchical classifier with the rejection of non-informative activity segments has been developed drawing on both direct pattern recognition and statistical signal features. Secondly, the recognized activities should be assessed, similarly to the scoring performed by patients themselves. This is achieved through the interval coded scoring (ICS) system, a novel method to extract an interpretable scoring system from data. The activity recognition reaches an average accuracy of 93.5%; assessment is currently 64.3% accurate. These results indicate the potential of the approach; a next step should be its validation in a larger patient study.</td><td>['Accelerometry', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Rheumatic Diseases', 'Time Factors']</td><td>['25885258', '25602883', '17101272', '19342767', '7699629', '3963537', '19447723', '27307537', '26389900', '24691168', '19147614', '22479598', '12809198', '2407929', '26690450', '24691526', '25844853', '18625618', '22425589', '22401146', '22922413', '5420325', '23161166', '22134002', '22692942', '19968879']</td></tr><tr><td>27999248</td><td>Recent Progress in Machine Learning-Based Methods for Protein Fold Recognition.</td><td>['Wei', 'Zou']</td><td>2016</td><td>International journal of molecular sciences</td><td>Knowledge on protein folding has a profound impact on understanding the heterogeneity and molecular function of proteins, further facilitating drug design.

With the development of next-generation sequencing techniques, the discovery of new protein sequences has been rapidly increasing. With such a great number of proteins, the use of experimental techniques to determine protein folding is extremely difficult because these techniques are time consuming and expensive. Thus, developing computational prediction methods that can automatically, rapidly, and accurately classify unknown protein sequences into specific fold categories is urgently needed. Computational recognition of protein folds has been a recent research hotspot in bioinformatics and computational biology. Many computational efforts have been made, generating a variety of computational prediction methods. In this review, we conduct a comprehensive survey of recent computational methods, especially machine learning-based methods, for protein fold recognition.

First, many oxidized lipids accumulate in CKD and were shown to exert toxic effects on cells and tissues. These lipids are known to interfere with many cell functions and to be pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory, especially in the cardiovascular system. Some, like F2-isoprostanes, are directly correlated with CKD progression. Their accumulation, added to their noxious effects, rendered their nomination as uremic toxins credible. Similarly, lipoproteins are deeply altered by CKD modifications, either in their metabolism or composition. These impairments lead to impaired effects of HDL on their normal effectors and may strongly participate in accelerated atherosclerosis and failure of statins in end-stage renal disease patients. This review describes the impact of oxidized lipids and other modifications in the natural history of CKD and its complications.

DSBs can be in the form of simple or complex breaks, and may be repaired by one of a number of processes, the nature of which depends on the complexity of the break or the position of the break within the chromatin. In eukaryotic cells, nuclear DNA is maintained as either euchromatin (EC) which is loosely packed, or in a denser form, much of which is heterochromatin (HC). Due to the less accessible nature of the DNA in HC as compared to that in EC, repair of damage in HC is not as straightforward as repair in EC.

Cathepsin K (Ctsk) is one of the cysteine proteases that is over-expressed in osteoclasts and accounts for the increase in bone resorption in metabolic bone disorders such as postmenopausal osteoporosis. It has been the focus of target based drug discovery in recent years. We have identified two components in RD, Kushennol F and Sophoraflavanone G, that can potentially interact with Ctsk. Biological studies were performed to verify the effects of these compounds on Ctsk and its related bone resorption process, which include the use of in vitro fluorescence-based Ctsk enzyme assay, bone resorption pit formation assay, as well as Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis using murine RAW264.7 cells. Finally, the binding mode and stability of these two compounds that interact with Ctsk were determined by molecular docking and dynamics methods.

Exposure to environmental pollutants during embryonic development is particularly risky. Although many pollutants have been verified as potential toxicants, there are new chemicals in the environment that need assessment. Heart development is an extremely sensitive process, which can be affected by environmentally toxic molecule exposure during embryonic development. Congenital heart defects are the most common life-threatening global health problems, and the etiology is mostly unknown. The zebrafish has emerged as an invaluable model to examine substance toxicity on vertebrate development, particularly on cardiac development. The zebrafish offers numerous advantages for toxicology research not found in other model systems. Many laboratories have used the zebrafish to study the effects of widespread chemicals in the environment on heart development, including pesticides, nanoparticles, and various organic pollutants. Here, we review the uses of the zebrafish in examining effects of exposure to external molecules during embryonic development in causing cardiac defects, including chemicals ubiquitous in the environment and illicit drugs.

Multistage focus group interviews were conducted with persons aged 61-72 living in Northern Sweden. A participatory and appreciative reflection and action (PAAR) approach was used in the group-sessions. Probes were used to increase reflections and achieve a deeper knowledge about the participants' needs of support. Data were analysed using qualitative thematic content analysis. Our findings revealed that to be able to succeed with a lifestyle change a focus has to be on a converted way of thinking, managing vulnerability, and achieving an emotional balance. To achieve a sustainable lifestyle change due to obesity in the third age the focus has to be on a health identity instead of a weight identity. Personalised support with enjoyable physical activities should be designed and developed. Strategies for emotional balance based on autonomy and self-empowerment must be included. This knowledge is important when designing support for sustainable change.</td><td>['Aged', 'Body Weight', 'Emotional Adjustment', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Focus Groups', 'Humans', 'Life Style', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity', 'Psychosocial Support Systems', 'Stress, Psychological']</td><td>['25134692', '16051931', '7899572', '18155989', '21818302', '23676799', '16208859', '1399871', '24876625', '21810992', '21325341', '19175510', '24081718', '25409001', '24139770', '20691328', '25563356', '23238403', '19114803', '15185831', '23810858', '19962265', '14769454', '19754633', '25019267', '22085706', '18155338']</td></tr><tr><td>27999266</td><td>Microbial Etiology of Pneumonia: Epidemiology, Diagnosis and Resistance Patterns.</td><td>['Cilloniz', 'Martin-Loeches', 'Garcia-Vidal', 'San Jose', 'Torres']</td><td>2016</td><td>International journal of molecular sciences</td><td>Globally, pneumonia is a serious public health concern and a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Despite advances in antimicrobial therapies, microbiological diagnostic tests and prevention measures, pneumonia remains the main cause of death from infectious disease in the world. An important reason for the increased global mortality is the impact of pneumonia on chronic diseases, along with the increasing age of the population and the virulence factors of the causative microorganism. The increasing number of multidrug-resistant bacteria, difficult-to-treat microorganisms, and the emergence of new pathogens are a major problem for clinicians when deciding antimicrobial therapy. A key factor for managing and effectively guiding appropriate antimicrobial therapy is an understanding of the role of the different causative microorganisms in the etiology of pneumonia, since it has been shown that the adequacy of initial antimicrobial therapy is a key factor for prognosis in pneumonia. Furthermore, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapies are sometimes given until microbiological results are available and de-escalation cannot be performed quickly.

Seven academic databases were searched for 26 peer reviewed articles that met inclusion criteria. Significant variability in the studies was noted, in age, travel duration and frequency and outcomes/risk factors measured and reported on. Risk factors described included longer duration of stay; being single; travel for romance or sex; alcohol and other drug use; lack of travel advice; being male; higher number of sexual partners; and inconsistent condom use. Vaccination, pre-travel health advice, and having fewer sexual partners were described as protective. Studies are needed focusing on the social context in which risk-taking occurs. Better collaboration is essential to deliver comprehensive health promotion interventions alongside more consistent pre- and post- travel testing and advice.

Lung cancer mortality increased in China over the study period from 78.77 to 85.63 (1/100,000), with higher mortality rates evident in men compared to women. Median rate ratios (MRRs) indicated important geographical variation in lung cancer mortality between provinces (MRR = 1.622) and counties/districts (MRR = 1.447). On average, lung cancer mortality increased over time and was positively associated with county-level urbanization (relative risk (RR) = 1.15). Lung cancer mortality seemed to decrease in urban and increase in rural areas. Compared to the northwest, mortality was higher in the north (RR = 1.98), east (RR = 1.87), central (RR = 1.87), and northeast (RR = 2.44).

In the present study, a sensitive ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection coupled with a linear ion trap-Orbitrap (UHPLC-DAD-LTQ-Orbitrap) method was established to screen and identify CGAs in Kuding tea. Six CGA standards were first analyzed in negative ion mode with a CID-MS/MS experiment and then the diagnostic product ions (DPIs) were summarized. According to the retention behavior in the RP-ODS column, accurate mass measurement, DPIs and relevant bibliography data, a total of 68 CGA candidates attributed to 12 categories were unambiguously or preliminarily screened and characterized within 18 min of chromatographic time.

This is probably achieved by an active transportation via mitochondrial melatonin transporter(s). Melatonin protects mitochondria by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibiting the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), and activating uncoupling proteins (UCPs). Thus, melatonin maintains the optimal mitochondrial membrane potential and preserves mitochondrial functions. In addition, mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics is also regulated by melatonin.

We also elucidated the underlying mechanism. Our results demonstrated that Se-PFPs inhibited cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced micronucleus formation in both bone marrow and peripheral blood, enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in mouse liver, and reduced the activity and expression of cytochrome P450 1A (CYP4501A) in mouse liver in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, we found that the anti-mutagenic potential of Se-PFPs was higher than those of PFPs, Se alone or Se + PFPs at the same level. These results suggest that the anti-mutagenic potential of Se-PFPs may be mediated through the inhibition of the activity and expression of CYP4501A.

VOO is rich in phenolic compounds and the health promoting benefits of these phenolics are now established. Recent studies have highlighted the biological properties of VOO phenolic compounds elucidating their anti-inflammatory activities. This paper will review current knowledge on the anti-inflammatory and nutrigenomic, chemoprotective and anti-atherosclerotic activities of VOO phenolics. In addition the concentration, metabolism and bioavailability of specific phenolic compounds will be discussed.

Different analytical techniques have been applied aimed at studying the organoleptic and characteristic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) profile of this cheese. However, most of the classical methods are time consuming and costly. The aim of this work was to illustrate a new simple, portable, fast, reliable, non-destructive, and economic sensor device S3 based on an array of six metal oxide semiconductor nanowire gas sensors to assess and discriminate the quality ranking of grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese samples and to identify the VOC biomarkers using a headspace SPME-GC-MS. The device could clearly differentiate cheese samples varying in quality and ripening time when the results were analyzed by multivariate statistical analysis involving principal component analysis (PCA). Similarly, the volatile constituents of Parmigiano Reggiano identified were consistent with the compounds intimated in the literature. The obtained results show the applicability of an S3 device combined with SPME-GC-MS and sensory evaluation for a fast and high-sensitivity analysis of VOCs in Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and for the quality control of this class of cheese.</td><td>['Biosensing Techniques', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Nanowires', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']</td><td>['22063140', '18474140', '17032999', '23450500', '25212373', '22438717', '12146465', '23396191', '27133588', '12403571', '22591108', '12703612', '12463695', '26870875', '9342826']</td></tr><tr><td>27999294</td><td>The Effect of Using Mobile Technology-Based Methods That Record Food or Nutrient Intake on Diabetes Control and Nutrition Outcomes: A Systematic Review.</td><td>['Porter', 'Huggins', 'Truby', 'Collins']</td><td>2016</td><td>Nutrients</td><td>(1) Background: Mobile technologies may be utilised for dietary intake assessment for people with diabetes.

These neurons are involved in a number of cognitive functions including attention, learning and memory. Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) are particularly vulnerable in a number of neurological diseases with the most notable being Alzheimer's disease, with evidence for a link between decreasing cholinergic markers and the degree of cognitive impairment. The neurotrophin growth factor system is present on these BFCNs and has been shown to promote survival and differentiation on these neurons. Clinical and animal model studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of 17β-estradiol (E2) on neurodegeneration in BFCNs. It is believed that E2 interacts with neurotrophin signaling on cholinergic neurons to mediate these beneficial effects. Evidence presented in our recent study confirms that altering the levels of circulating E2 levels via ovariectomy and E2 replacement significantly affects the expression of the neurotrophin receptors on BFCN. However, we also showed that E2 differentially regulates neurotrophin receptor expression on BFCNs with effects depending on neurotrophin receptor type and neuroanatomical location. In this review, we aim to survey the current literature to understand the influence of E2 on the neurotrophin system, and the receptors and signaling pathways it mediates on BFCN. In addition, we summarize the physiological and pathophysiological significance of E2 actions on the neurotrophin system in BFCN, especially focusing on changes related to Alzheimer's disease.</td><td>['Alzheimer Disease', 'Animals', 'Basal Forebrain', 'Cholinergic Neurons', 'Cognitive Dysfunction', 'Estradiol', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Memory', 'Mice', 'Nerve Growth Factors', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor', 'Signal Transduction']</td><td>['11152678', '15966860', '9852573', '24040818', '15582747', '15609090', '27521573', '2779653', '18199491', '12787319', '4041042', '20965156', '10588810', '10447781', '6136314', '25147108', '9472688', '10657006', '11717247', '9075237', '22165673', '7701324', '16855103', '11378248', '10368772', '16024751', '8782897', '7283399', '1316615', '16203092', '16096020', '12694373', '9927421', '1649007', '22217824', '16288118', '21844907', '11172057', '10368774', '18579753', '8931004', '11906788', '2558781', '4415090', '7845585', '18297067', '8848287', '9130295', '10066247', '8078914', '3532929', '9398750', '8325866', '22377499', '7597126', '8050041', '11452016', '9689481', '10681512', '9628764', '8650195', '8782539', '9191758', '9454839', '7554147', '17046690', '7472485', '10077336', '23769397', '9187280', '19317180', '11520181', '15213206', '10833325', '8780008', '9915784', '10851172', '8117429', '8920907', '20045216', '9315882', '10511696', '15217092', '8915574', '2169269', '27327261', '10323667', '10683408', '8468401', '1850549', '8137419', '11043579', '8090165', '891467', '17615392', '9733161', '22915112', '1613547', '3183710', '8332899', '1742028', '8144877', '16611827', '12169297', '8446107', '14824426', '14580942', '8423470', '9809515', '8030628', '7671302', '9566385', '6382047', '16510735', '9547236', '7058341', '11871', '1432101', '16893414', '7598845', '12571449', '15539556', '2422449', '11729324', '2420562', '2990988', '2842704', '18420744', '10683291', '19815003', '23771838', '22019477', '23196064', '12117397', '23964066', '16149083', '10477751', '9200493', '7890832', '24172877', '21791565', '3798108', '3399046', '12143394', '9573399', '4600633', '3388021', '11821512', '1422811', '21320576', '2556457', '1382329', '20478440', '14573532', '15364411', '748049', '2183081', '20506473', '9048584', '9733072', '26879842', '837883', '12753077', '12351713', '16750837', '11773440', '9576759', '7605062', '21816388', '6110089', '1688328', '24680650', '3774818', '20019181', '13567043', '2171894', '25415243', '15893308', '10899288', '16365303', '7925844', '7470857', '15837589', '10675382', '9367686', '21145918', '9051746', '1327010', '10508738', '19207809', '17406656', '3746405', '10322180', '8774454', '11488923', '7188352', '3455786', '21114983', '1672782', '9852160', '13234368', '719462', '4134992', '9546791', '9252024', '18700946', '9410912', '19912958', '2411537', '12843274', '27371762', '10234043', '2158008', '16651814', '7479947', '9388012', '8642406', '7509608', '9799621', '1954907', '24009071', '17010478', '4295833', '9768588', '23362079', '10430489', '22655593', '27317847', '19560872', '20875808', '8521509', '8614802', '1706478', '9398443', '19427328', '8702822', '8027442', '8486743', '8248223', '22442072', '16539663']</td></tr><tr><td>27999303</td><td>Metabolomic Approaches to Explore Chemical Diversity of Human Breast-Milk, Formula Milk and Bovine Milk.</td><td>['Qian', 'Zhao', 'Zhang', 'Chen', 'Zeisel', 'Jia', 'Cai']</td><td>2016</td><td>International journal of molecular sciences</td><td>Although many studies have been conducted on the components present in human breast milk (HM), research on the differences of chemical metabolites between HM, bovine milk (BM) and formula milk (FM) is limited. This study was to explore the chemical diversity of HM, BM and FM by metabolomic approaches. GC-TOFMS and UPLC-QTOFMS were applied to investigate the metabolic compositions in 30 HM samples, 20 FM samples and 20 BM samples. Metabolite profiling identified that most of the non-esterified fatty acids, which reflected the hydrolysis of triglycerides, were much more abundant in HM than those in FM and BM, except for palmitic acid and stearic acid. The levels of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) intermediates were much higher in FM and BM than those in HM. Each type of milk also showed its unique composition of free amino acids and free carbohydrates. In conclusion, higher levels of non-esterified saturated fatty acids with aliphatic tails <16 carbons, monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids and lower levels of TCA intermediates are characteristic of HM, as compared with FM and BM. The content of non-esterified fatty acids may reflect the hydrolysis of triglycerides in different milk types.</td><td>['Adult', 'Amino Acids', 'Carbohydrates', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Female', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Infant Formula', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Metabolomics', 'Milk, Human', 'Triglycerides']</td><td>['16456418', '25897128', '20450531', '23349482', '25989994', '23025771', '7876988', '23932110', '17202168', '22439776', '22115128', '3972442', '17726021', '11988033', '16254515', '25164443', '23892396', '17823433', '24683534', '24441088', '17918475', '20043295', '24173620', '25959062', '24704120', '26655810', '24800664', '16382755', '22364884', '24027187', '17311985', '10649565', '7408909', '11003602', '24699309', '11063477', '23178071', '24194979', '13654509', '23842459', '26048966', '24752468', '15657476', '3494228', '15652751', '7965455', '10569230', '21534545', '18027994', '8315552', '24415683', '25686043', '22946146', '23970212', '23372130', '19636438', '25058331', '8317386', '22357724', '18184094', '18296381', '24079341', '12530557', '16921475']</td></tr><tr><td>27999304</td><td>A Possible Role of Intestinal Microbiota in the Pathogenesis of Ankylosing Spondylitis.</td><td>['Yang', 'Wang', 'Wang', 'Xian', 'Lu']</td><td>2016</td><td>International journal of molecular sciences</td><td>Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease primarily affecting the sacroiliac joints and the spine, for which the pathogenesis is thought to be a result of the combination of host genetic factors and environmental triggers.

With 100 trillion bacteria residing in the mammalian gut having established a symbiotic relation with their host influencing many aspects of host metabolism, physiology, and immunity, a growing body of evidence suggests that intestinal microbiota may play an important role in AS. Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain the potential role of the microbiome in the etiology of AS, such as alterations of intestinal permeability, stimulation of immune responses, and molecular mimicry. In this review, the existing evidence for the involvement of the microbiome in AS pathogenesis was discussed and the potential of intestinal microbiome-targeting strategies in the prevention and treatment of AS was evaluated.</td><td>['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Fecal Microbiota Transplantation', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Humans', 'Intestines', 'Prebiotics', 'Probiotics', 'Rats', 'Sacroiliac Joint', 'Spine', 'Spondylitis, Ankylosing']</td><td>['23252997', '23755726', '24424191', '23975857', '27617200', '27214393', '6992718', '26849723', '27713770', '25488778', '17458395', '26331579', '22095454', '27048899', '27330858', '27484959', '25967460', '23806346', '27370879', '26002454', '18190710', '3777713', '24303043', '7964509', '27126044', '1856808', '8019793', '27708874', '25437282', '27666819', '18779392', '1616364', '24399149', '26663940', '23128233', '16239843', '27522986', '24855012', '22945443', '25973440', '16941202', '26939622', '27172442', '24080254', '23750937', '21959580', '18497880', '26929784', '27500859', '24351517', '27165176', '27734413', '8835506', '10338507', '26244577', '16819502', '26080708', '27641915', '27708888', '27025836', '15361397', '22454761', '24450998', '20838859', '23257018', '26561014', '27713957', '23969080', '25385438', '12584218', '19333939', '27650612', '25412961', '7649265', '22827693', '27161355', '27542133', '22908082', '27428948', '25140823', '26729099', '25119827', '26362740', '25631513', '9002020', '24942685', '27734904', '15158604', '24664521', '12949256', '26565676', '23781254', '18840492', '23508523', '27738838', '26458738', '26009213', '21904999', '27565581', '10525115', '23222204', '27152700', '21792826', '27047989', '24340048', '24498993', '26370944', '9135221', '25902790', '25599143', '26320138', '20876114', '25574083', '22272527', '20716665', '27045424', '10555027', '12468819', '19333931', '23820129', '21955846', '6769456', '27708964', '10820072', '348130', '25852213', '25417597', '27729335', '27075688', '24504793', '27634186', '27182210', '26146498', '27002532', '27302484', '23016134', '8770866', '22360441', '27390077', '27380601', '26599385', '27641916', '22683238', '27729768', '23906073', '26339141', '27161356', '25836986']</td></tr><tr><td>27999305</td><td>Implementation of a Nutrition Program Reduced Post-Discharge Growth Restriction in Thai Very Low Birth Weight Preterm Infants.</td><td>['Japakasetr', 'Sirikulchayanonta', 'Suthutvoravut', 'Chindavijak', 'Kagawa', 'Nokdee']</td><td>2016</td><td>Nutrients</td><td>p = 0.004) compared to their historical comparison counterparts.

In breast primary cancer, the five-year survival rate is close to 100%; however, for metastatic breast cancer, that rate drops to a mere 25%, due in part to the paucity of effective therapeutic options for treating metastases. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that consumption of natural polyphenols significantly reduces the risk of cancer metastasis. Therefore, this review summarizes the research findings involving the molecular mechanisms and metabolomics of natural polyphenols and how they may be blocking breast cancer metastasis. Most natural polyphenols are thought to impair breast cancer metastasis through downregulation of MMPs expression, interference with the VEGF signaling pathway, modulation of EMT regulator, inhibition of NF-κB and mTOR expression, and other related mechanisms. Intake of natural polyphenols has been shown to impact endogenous metabolites and complex biological metabolic pathways in vivo. Breast cancer metastasis is a complicated process in which each step is modulated by a complex network of signaling pathways. We hope that by detailing the reported interactions between breast cancer metastasis and natural polyphenols, more attention will be directed to these promising candidates as effective adjunct therapies against metastatic breast cancer in the clinic.</td><td>['Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Metabolomics', 'NF-kappa B', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Polyphenols', 'Signal Transduction']</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>27999308</td><td>A Smartphone Application for Personal Assessments of Body Composition and Phenotyping.</td><td>['Farina', 'Spataro', 'De Lorenzo', 'Lukaski']</td><td>2016</td><td>Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)</td><td>p = 0.96) for females and males, respectively.

The DPPH (1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl), ABTS [2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] scavenging and inhibition of lipid oxidation, which test the oleoresin from the three kinds of citrus, exhibited significant antioxidant capacity. The component polymethoxyflavones contributed the greatest share of the overall antioxidant capacity, while the limonoid and phytosterol components effectively coordinated with its effects.</td><td>['Antioxidants', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromatography, Supercritical Fluid', 'Citrus', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Plant Extracts', 'Taiwan', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>27999313</td><td>Estimation of Temporal Gait Parameters Using a Wearable Microphone-Sensor-Based System.</td><td>['Wang', 'Wang', 'Long', 'Yuan', 'Qian', 'Li']</td><td>2016</td><td>Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)</td><td>Most existing wearable gait analysis methods focus on the analysis of data obtained from inertial sensors. This paper proposes a novel, low-cost, wireless and wearable gait analysis system which uses microphone sensors to collect footstep sound signals during walking. This is the first time a microphone sensor is used as a wearable gait analysis device as far as we know. Based on this system, a gait analysis algorithm for estimating the temporal parameters of gait is presented. The algorithm fully uses the fusion of two feet footstep sound signals and includes three stages: footstep detection, heel-strike event and toe-on event detection, and calculation of gait temporal parameters. Experimental results show that with a total of 240 data sequences and 1732 steps collected using three different gait data collection strategies from 15 healthy subjects, the proposed system achieves an average 0.955 F1-measure for footstep detection, an average 94.52% accuracy rate for heel-strike detection and 94.25% accuracy rate for toe-on detection. Using these detection results, nine temporal related gait parameters are calculated and these parameters are consistent with their corresponding normal gait temporal parameters and labeled data calculation results. The results verify the effectiveness of our proposed system and algorithm for temporal gait parameter estimation.</td><td>['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Female', 'Gait', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Probability', 'Software', 'Time Factors', 'Wearable Electronic Devices', 'Young Adult']</td><td>['15336283', '20703612', '16315476', '17928063', '25769144', '27516008', '27131180', '22438727', '11714558', '15886131']</td></tr><tr><td>27999315</td><td>Circulating Cell-Free DNA Levels Could Predict Oncological Outcomes of Patients Undergoing Esophagectomy for Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.</td><td>['Hsieh', 'Hsu', 'Chang', 'Chen']</td><td>2016</td><td>International journal of molecular sciences</td><td>p = 0.164).

However, its pharmacokinetic profile remains largely undefined. Here, Sprague Dawley rats were administered a single dose of GRFT at 10 or 20 mg/kg by intravenous, oral, and subcutaneous routes, respectively, and serum GRFT levels were measured at select time points. In addition, the potential for systemic accumulation after oral dosing was assessed in rats after 10 daily treatments with GRFT (20 or 40 mg/kg). We found that parenterally-administered GRFT in rats displayed a complex elimination profile, which varied according to administration routes. However, GRFT was not orally bioavailable, even after chronic treatment. Nonetheless, active GRFT capable of neutralizing HIV-Env pseudoviruses was detected in rat fecal extracts after chronic oral dosing. These findings support further evaluation of GRFT for pre-exposure prophylaxis against emerging epidemics for which specific therapeutics are not available, including systemic and enteric infections caused by susceptible enveloped viruses. In addition, GRFT should be considered for antiviral therapy and the prevention of rectal transmission of HIV-1 and other susceptible viruses.</td><td>['Administration, Intravenous', 'Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Biological Availability', 'Feces', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Plant Lectins', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Serum', 'Time Factors']</td><td>['1020594', '22874836', '17253483', '17340634', '20516066', '18432938', '17398101', '17567736', '23536670', '11365132', '16843894', '21802104', '22209231', '21858152', '21367772', '22851920', '20826337', '22963555', '19332801', '20032190', '22970469', '24145548', '15613479', '22611520', '20392471', '21288816', '24903270', '20643940', '21829638', '21896910', '21623623', '22607556', '2029809', '20080975', '23053519', '23299465']</td></tr><tr><td>27999319</td><td>Antimicrobial Activity and Urease Inhibition of Schiff Bases Derived from Isoniazid and Fluorinated Benzaldehydes and of Their Copper(II) Complexes.</td><td>['Habala', 'Varényi', 'Bilková', 'Herich', 'Valentová', 'Kožíšek', 'Devínsky']</td><td>2016</td><td>Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)</td><td>C. albicans.

The targeting of cytotoxic payloads via the specificity and selectivity of the antibody has led to substantial clinical benefits.

DeBouganin is a de-immunized variant of bouganin, a ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) that blocks protein synthesis, thereby leading to apoptosis. When conjugated to trastuzumab (T-deB), deBouganin was more potent than ado-trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) and unaffected by resistance mechanisms to which DM1 is susceptible. To further highlight the differentiating mechanism of action of deBouganin, HCC1419 and BT-474 tumor cells that survived T-DM1 or trastuzumab-MMAE (T-MMAE) treatment were treated with an anti-HER2 C6.5 diabody-deBouganin fusion protein or T-deB. C6.5 diabody-deBouganin and T-deB were potent against HCC1419 and BT-474 cells that were resistant to T-DM1 or T-MMAE killing.

Based on their enhanced specificity, selectivity and versatility, bio-affinity assays have inspired many researchers to develop sensors by exploring bio-recognition phenomena. However, a significant problem in the fabrication of these devices is that most of the biomolecules do not generate an easily measurable signal upon binding to the target analytes, and signal-generating labels are required to perform the measurements. In this context, aptamers have been emerged as a potential and attractive bio-recognition element to design label-free aptasensors for various target analytes. Contrary to other bioreceptor-based approaches, the aptamer-based assays rely on antigen binding-induced conformational changes or oligomerization states rather than binding-assisted changes in adsorbed mass or charge. This review will focus on current designs in label-free conformational switchable design strategies, with a particular focus on applications in the detection of mycotoxins.</td><td>['Aptamers, Nucleotide', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Colorimetry', 'DNA, Catalytic', 'Mycotoxins', 'Staining and Labeling']</td><td>['25153252', '16113717', '18176631', '16579607', '24690563', '15382892', '23214491', '24984866', '26343432', '17378540', '19522530', '24590125', '16366535', '20078091', '20408164', '19227981', '24201319', '17891385', '21614178', '21559531', '19928834', '15079825', '22326894', '23152052', '11093194', '23200352', '24287543', '26001087', '17115929', '22221796', '24747570', '24465818', '26695291', '25901535', '18983163', '15854817', '19072036', '19559590', '27318356', '17600802', '23534943', '24148439', '26320651', '23535890', '25682251', '12298044', '21227676', '26353655', '14759196', '24196457', '27592242', '9222502', '24424458', '21514815', '20970980', '23948242', '23500359', '24549114', '20820687', '25836665', '23089328', '23498252', '19473883', '21264402', '24287535', '26844813', '23615920', '27568847', '17036292', '27807347', '20636040', '23748593', '10501507', '8068232', '10471678', '1697402']</td></tr><tr><td>27999348</td><td>Modulation of GLO1 Expression Affects Malignant Properties of Cells.</td><td>['Hutschenreuther', 'Bigl', 'Hemdan', 'Debebe', 'Gaunitz', 'Birkenmeier']</td><td>2016</td><td>International journal of molecular sciences</td><td>The energy metabolism of most tumor cells relies on aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) characterized by an increased glycolytic flux that is accompanied by the increased formation of the cytotoxic metabolite methylglyoxal (MGO). Consequently, the rate of detoxification of this reactive glycolytic byproduct needs to be increased in order to prevent deleterious effects to the cells. This is brought about by an increased expression of glyoxalase 1 (GLO1) that is the rate-limiting enzyme of the MGO-detoxifying glyoxalase system. Here, we overexpressed GLO1 in HEK 293 cells and silenced it in MCF-7 cells using shRNA. Tumor-related properties of wild type and transformed cells were compared and key glycolytic enzyme activities assessed. Furthermore, the cells were subjected to hypoxic conditions to analyze the impact on cell proliferation and enzyme activities. Our results demonstrate that knockdown of GLO1 in the cancer cells significantly reduced tumor-associated properties such as migration and proliferation, whereas no functional alterations where found by overexpression of GLO1 in HEK 293 cells. In contrast, hypoxia caused inhibition of cell growth of all cells except of those overexpressing GLO1. Altogether, we conclude that GLO1 on one hand is crucial to maintaining tumor characteristics of malignant cells, and, on the other hand, supports malignant transformation of cells in a hypoxic environment when overexpressed.</td><td>['Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Female', 'Glutathione', 'Glycolysis', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lactoylglutathione Lyase', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Pyruvaldehyde', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering']</td><td>['20048078', '18425820', '16085563', '20435681', '12776180', '2725076', '20544845', '21569415', '4250815', '15516961', '7154966', '21516121', '22614840', '21056979', '26971627', '24646268', '20454679', '12438266', '8120095', '19211689', '9553122', '18946510', '18337823', '20797448', '27579985', '19690140', '22188542', '20691487', '21315826', '10972486', '1537826', '20139893', '20204770', '19619488', '24966916', '16766262', '9915484', '19833897', '19497135', '20093988', '22001178', '7619046', '19872213', '10098401', '8752123', '11489834', '9163322', '19460998', '942051', '8683979', '10597025', '18625205', '14641060', '8399366', '19563799', '11368412', '8476206', '188543']</td></tr><tr><td>27999349</td><td>Recent Methods for Purification and Structure Determination of Oligonucleotides.</td><td>['Zhang', 'Lv', 'Wang', 'Chen', 'Li', 'Liang', 'Yu', 'Jiang', 'Lu', 'Zhang']</td><td>2016</td><td>International journal of molecular sciences</td><td>Aptamers are single-stranded DNA or RNA oligonucleotides that can interact with target molecules through specific three-dimensional structures.

It is characterised by widespread keratinocyte apoptosis and sloughing of the skin, erosions of the mucous membranes, painful blistering, and severe systemic disturbance. The pathophysiology of TEN is incompletely understood. Historically, it has been regarded as a drug-induced immune reaction initiated by cytotoxic lymphocytes via a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted pathway. Several mediators have been identified as contributors to the cell death seen in TEN, including; granulysin, soluble Fas ligand, perforin/granzyme, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. Currently, granulysin is accepted as the most important mediator of T cell proliferation. There is uncertainty around the accepted management of TEN. The lack of definitive management guidelines for TEN is explained in part by the rarity of the disease and its high mortality rate, which makes it difficult to conduct randomised control trials on emerging therapies. Developments have been made in pharmacogenomics, with numerous HLA alleles identified; however, these have largely been ethnically specific. These associations have translated into screening recommendations for Han Chinese.</td><td>['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Apoptosis', 'Cyclosporine', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Epidermis', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Granzymes', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous', 'Infliximab', 'Keratinocytes', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Perforin', 'Stevens-Johnson Syndrome', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']</td><td>['12164739', '8691227', '9843104', '22285617', '7588837', '15536433', '19029983', '9433029', '23957982', '24007192', '9774279', '11966713', '20500799', '21906289', '17340021', '18692887', '16210071', '10606987', '2036029', '11224848', '15875523', '25087214', '7477195', '9129696', '22458671', '21428768', '8466217', '27317286', '23866878', '19912214', '12707034', '25672763', '24322785', '21428769', '8733377', '10951229', '16086734', '23389396', '27317272', '27406069', '24928706', '17805350', '18192896', '23799330', '20456393', '13374196', '21149285', '17224365', '22145749']</td></tr><tr><td>27999351</td><td>Diabetic Cardiomyopathy: Does the Type of Diabetes Matter?</td><td>['Hölscher', 'Bode', 'Bugger']</td><td>2016</td><td>International journal of molecular sciences</td><td>In recent years, type 2 diabetes mellitus has evolved as a rapidly increasing epidemic that parallels the increased prevalence of obesity and which markedly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease across the globe. While ischemic heart disease represents the major cause of death in diabetic subjects, diabetic cardiomyopathy (DC) summarizes adverse effects of diabetes mellitus on the heart that are independent of coronary artery disease (CAD) and hypertension. DC increases the risk of heart failure (HF) and may lead to both heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Numerous molecular mechanisms have been proposed to underlie DC that partially overlap with mechanisms believed to contribute to heart failure. Nevertheless, the existence of DC remains a topic of controversy, although the clinical relevance of DC is increasingly recognized by scientists and clinicians. In addition, relatively little attention has been attributed to the fact that both underlying mechanisms and clinical features of DC may be partially distinct in type 1 versus type 2 diabetes.

The practice remains controversial and can be interpreted as a beneficial self-regulating behavior or the opposite, an eating disorder that may have a detrimental effect on health. The aim of this short report was to investigate if dietary restrictions are associated with dietary patterns in a representative sample of Polish girls. Analyses were carried out on data from the Girls' Eating Behavior and Health (GEBaHealth) study. The sample included 1107 girls, ranging in age from 13 to 21 years old. Restrictions regarding food quantities and selected food groups were assessed using a standardized interview. Dietary patterns were identified with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), based on dietary data collected with Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQs). Logistic regression analysis was used to study the associations between self-reported restrictions and each dietary pattern. In the total sample, 30.5% of girls reported following some food restrictions. The most common restrictions regarded consumption of sugar and/or sweets (23.7%), high-fat foods (22.4%), and fats (21.3%). Girls who declared following any restrictions, restrictions in food quantity and restrictions in the consumption of sugar and/or sweets, high-fat foods, fats, cereals and/or bread and/or potatoes were more likely to adhere to the \"\"fruit and vegetables\"\" (considered pro-healthy) dietary pattern (adjusted odds ratios (ORs): 1.55, 95% CI: 1.14-2.12; 1.61, 95% CI: 1.17-2.21; 1.81, 95% CI: 1.30-2.52; 1.46, 95% CI: 1.04-2.06; 1.96, 95% CI: 1.38-2.80 and 3.25, 95% CI: 1.97-5.37, respectively), and less likely to adhere to the \"\"fast foods and sweets\"\" (unhealthy) and \"\"traditional Polish\"\" (rather unhealthy) patterns, compared to girls who declared no restrictions. Declared restrictions in the consumption of foods high in sugar, fat, and starch were observed in girls in the \"\"fruit and vegetables\"\" pattern and were uncommon in girls with unhealthy dietary patterns.

Here we examine the effect of A6, a pesticide derived from the naturally-occurring α-terthienyl, and structurally related to the endocrine disrupting pesticides anilinopyrimidines, on living zebrafish larvae. We show that both A6 and an anilinopyrimidine, cyprodinyl, decrease larval survival and affect central neurons at micromolar concentrations. Focusing on a superficial and easily observable sensory system, the lateral line system, we found that defects in axonal and sensory cell regeneration can be observed at much lower doses, in the nanomolar range. We also show that A6 accumulates preferentially in lateral line neurons and hair cells. We examined whether A6 affects the expression of putative target genes, and found that genes involved in apoptosis/cell proliferation are down-regulated, as well as genes reflecting estrogen receptor activation, consistent with previous reports that anilinopyrimidines act as endocrine disruptors. On the other hand, canonical targets of endocrine signaling are not affected, suggesting that the neurotoxic effect of A6 may be due to the binding of this compound to a recently identified, neuron-specific estrogen receptor.</td><td>['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biological Control Agents', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Larva', 'Lateral Line System', 'Mechanoreceptors', 'Nerve Regeneration', 'Pyrimidines', 'Pyrimidinones', 'Receptors, Estrogen', 'Spinal Cord', 'Thiophenes', 'Zebrafish']</td><td>['17785522', '21362587', '23772207', '23436777', '25948382', '10771194', '22140581', '21356178', '19285126', '7823319', '18848822', '11232306', '23767830', '15705806', '22016521', '24059332', '25260197', '20368126', '26876344', '25944383', '19014500', '23583372', '27687478', '22987058', '27232122', '27266973', '19129512', '27133234', '19125657', '22372605', '19246619', '18648619', '24474787', '25912032', '15119603', '19767412', '16931750', '422557', '15042710', '17379646', '20292435', '27180838', '18510934', '27790224', '17470522', '21306193', '15018940', '26809712', '17492136', '27591376']</td></tr><tr><td>27999357</td><td>Alterations of Epigenetic Regulators in Pancreatic Cancer and Their Clinical Implications.</td><td>['Silverman', 'Shi']</td><td>2016</td><td>International journal of molecular sciences</td><td>Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive human cancer types with a five-year survival less than 7%. Emerging evidence revealed that many genetic alterations in pancreatic cancer target epigenetic regulators. Some of these mutations are driver mutations in cancer development. Several most important mechanisms of epigenetic regulations include DNA methylation, histone modifications (methylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination), chromatin remodeling, and non-coding ribonucleic acids (RNAs). These modifications can alter chromatin structure and promoter accessibility, and thus lead to aberrant gene expression. However, exactly how these alterations affect epigenetic reprogramming in pancreatic cancer cells and in different stages of tumor development is still not clear. This mini-review summarizes the current knowledge of epigenetic alterations in pancreatic cancer development and progression, and discusses the clinical applications of epigenetic regulators as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in pancreatic cancer.</td><td>['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Methylases', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones', 'Humans', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms']</td><td>['23498939', '22842901', '24301926', '26696517', '25659580', '21665894', '21243710', '24751816', '18922463', '22764048', '17676975', '16136652', '23036577', '265581', '23229642', '17713477', '22907667', '27708234', '20952535', '12193640', '18487953', '19424621', '20614181', '27689400', '25792600', '18374642', '23329235', '26422137', '27838375', '22045190', '22156295', '19106647', '2540826', '21909380', '26758190', '10700188', '21412491', '25801033', '22498722', '27639768', '26862857', '24088737', '25621113', '22301400', '22783274', '10638745', '27337224', '24585446', '24534469', '27593928', '25101834', '27893715', '25578037', '26454216', '27213290', '27376512', '18506539', '22536950', '25695794', '25401693', '21301206', '17804764', '21271301', '11782440', '27028998', '23040067', '8982460', '21932133', '24561622', '27728808', '22265691', '20573371', '25900667', '24114270', '21108789', '23139258', '18980972', '27891190', '25939753', '25431952', '12193644', '27573434', '19581485', '22233809', '15342650', '24976721', '27487558', '23684747', '22622284', '22498752', '17320513', '19528037', '27631726', '27799657', '19569050', '24500968', '17200670', '25855536', '26684344', '25279926', '17998812', '25719666', '15386022', '19912635', '25738536', '23807219', '17909537', '24315373', '24920070', '18772889', '16373483', '27654579', '24859458', '11399089', '21455317', '26716510', '24627783', '10590159', '19723895', '23671007', '21660058', '26909576', '25071823', '22915829', '16723979', '24423239', '27187371', '24622842', '23660946', '23752880', '26750583']</td></tr><tr><td>27999359</td><td>Phenotypic Stability of Energy Balance Responses to Experimental Total Sleep Deprivation and Sleep Restriction in Healthy Adults.</td><td>['Dennis', 'Spaeth', 'Goel']</td><td>2016</td><td>Nutrients</td><td>p < 0.001).

Oral administration of nucleic acids from salmon milt have physiological functions in the cellular metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of human small intestinal epithelial cells. In this study, we examined the effects of DNA-rich nucleic acids prepared from salmon milt (DNSM) on the development of liver fibrosis in an in vivo ethanol-carbon tetrachloride cirrhosis model. Plasma aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase were significantly less active in the DNSM-treated group than in the ethanol plus carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄)-treated group. Collagen accumulation in the liver and hepatic necrosis were observed histologically in ethanol plus CCl₄-treated rats; however, DNSM-treatment fully protected rats against ethanol plus CCl₄-induced liver fibrosis and necrosis. Furthermore, we examined whether DNSM had a preventive effect against alcohol-induced liver injury by regulating the cytochrome p450 2E1 (CYP2E1)-mediated oxidative stress pathway in an in vivo model. In this model, CYP2E1 activity in ethanol plus CCl₄-treated rats increased significantly, but DNSM-treatment suppressed the enzyme's activity and reduced intracellular thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels. Furthermore, the hepatocytes treated with 100 mM ethanol induced an increase in cell death and were not restored to the control levels when treated with DNSM, suggesting that digestive products of DNSM are effective for the prevention of alcohol-induced liver injury. Deoxyadenosine suppressed the ethanol-induced increase in cell death and increased the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase. These results suggest that DNSM treatment represents a novel tool for the prevention of alcohol-induced liver injury.</td><td>['Administration, Oral', 'Alanine Transaminase', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases', 'Carbon Tetrachloride', 'Collagen', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1', 'DNA', 'Ethanol', 'Glutathione', 'Hepatocytes', 'Humans', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver Diseases', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', 'Nucleoproteins', 'Rats', 'Salmon', 'Superoxide Dismutase']</td><td>['11173977', '3597381', '7646058', '25680468', '7615836', '9028626', '19398236', '19553649', '3766314', '16823475', '16923312', '4386718', '672656', '10569229', '8632215', '12787915', '16202036', '2443492', '23312286', '11668021', '11387231', '22387226', '25994141', '9665827', '18341647', '1856184', '26096275', '25196093', '23688501', '3877727', '2673971', '36810', '2113829', '15345911', '10869901', '23232950', '14734144', '7931703', '24269941']</td></tr><tr><td>27999362</td><td>Effect of Lead (Pb) on Inflammatory Processes in the Brain.</td><td>['Chibowska', 'Baranowska-Bosiacka', 'Falkowska', 'Gutowska', 'Goschorska', 'Chlubek']</td><td>2016</td><td>International journal of molecular sciences</td><td>That the nervous system is the main target of lead (Pb) has long been considered an established fact until recent evidence has linked the Pb effect on the immune system to the toxic effects of Pb on the nervous system.

Human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (CNE) cells were treated with triptolide, ionizing radiation, or triptolide plus ionizing radiation in vitro. Tumor potency was examined in an in vivo CNE cell xenograft mouse model, which was treated as above. Our results demonstrated that triptolide caused a significant reduction in cell growth and colony number, and induced a marked apoptosis that was further enhanced with increasing doses of ionizing radiation. Combination treatment synergistically reduced tumor weight and volume without obvious toxicity. Western blot analysis in vitro and in vivo showed that triptolide induced apoptotic protein Bax expression and inhibited phosph-NF-κB p65, Bcl-2 and VEGF proteins without affecting other NF-κB related protein expression. In conclusion, our findings revealed that triptolide plus ionizing radiation had synergistic anti-tumor and anti-angiogenesis effects in NPC via down-regulating NF-κB p65 phosphorylation.

The present study investigated the effects of work stressors, social support, and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor (5-HTR2A) genotype on the etiology of job strain among petroleum workers in Xinjiang. A cross-sectional study was carried out between January and August 2013. A total of 700 workers were selected by a three-stage stratified sampling method. 5-HTR2A genotypes were determined with the SNaPshot single nucleotide polymorphism assay. Work stressors and job strain were evaluated with the Occupational Stress Inventory-Revised questionnaire. Social support was assessed with the Chinese Social Support Rating Scale. Work overload and responsibility were significantly associated with job strain. Low social support was associated with severe vocational and interpersonal strain. High social support was a protective factor against job strain (odds ratio (OR) = 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.14-0.76). The CC genotype of rs6313 and the AA genotype of rs2070040 were linked to severe vocational strain. Ordinal logistic regression analysis revealed that the CC genotype of rs6313 was linked to higher risk of job strain than the TT genotype (OR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.10-3.23).

The present study examined whether AOS pretreatment could protect against acute DOX cardiotoxicity, and the underlying mechanisms focused on oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum-mediated apoptosis. We found that AOS pretreatment markedly increased the survival rate of mice insulted with DOX, improved DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction and attenuated DOX-induced myocardial apoptosis. AOS pretreatment mitigated DOX-induced cardiac oxidative stress, as shown by the decreased expressions of gp91 (phox) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Moreover, AOS pretreatment significantly decreased the expression of Caspase-12, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) (markers for endoplasmic reticulum-mediated apoptosis) and Bax (a downstream molecule of CHOP), while up-regulating the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Taken together, these findings identify AOS as a potent compound that prevents acute DOX cardiotoxicity, at least in part, by suppression of oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum-mediated apoptosis.</td><td>['Aldehydes', 'Alginates', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Biomarkers', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Caspase 12', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Doxorubicin', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Glucuronic Acid', 'Hexuronic Acids', 'Mice', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Receptors, Immunologic', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Transcription Factor CHOP']</td><td>['19699179', '20884632', '15289376', '1928418', '19527680', '1403481', '10819076', '14685163', '18805781', '2203071', '22465037', '12474900', '26838784', '22370326', '11158311', '26075032', '2842038', '21364565', '16771662', '20303879', '20625112', '21543116', '11432882', '25658604', '21371694', '21030724', '26984939', '9744975', '14638624', '24879640', '17223128', '20628130', '26389923', '10482014', '23142469', '16397583', '25483391', '26025579', '27210827', '20044139', '21307642', '22203419', '15336309', '17613823', '23989717']</td></tr><tr><td>27999372</td><td>Meta-Analysis of Milk Consumption and the Risk of Cognitive Disorders.</td><td>['Wu', 'Sun']</td><td>2016</td><td>Nutrients</td><td>p = 0.001).

Stroke is a major source of disability, including dysphagia. The clinical manifestation of swallowing difficulties in stroke patients may lead to malnutrition which has implications for health status and clinical outcomes including morbidity, mortality and cost to the health service. The prevalence of malnutrition following an acute stroke could range from 8% to 34%. Therefore, the need to develop and implement the use of enteral nutrition support in stroke patients becomes pertinent. A range of enteral feeding tubes and feeding methods may be used to support stroke patients who are unable to meet their nutritional requirements through oral intake alone, although each of these approaches has its merits and limitations. Based on this review, there is evidence that enteral nutrition support is a useful method of providing nutrition for patients with dysphagia following a stroke in order to enhance their nutritional status and promote their health. However, there are challenges in the use of enteral tube feeding in these patients.</td><td>['Deglutition Disorders', 'Enteral Nutrition', 'Humans', 'Malnutrition', 'Nutrition Assessment', 'Nutritional Status', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Risk Factors', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Rehabilitation', 'Treatment Outcome']</td><td>['26450671', '24107865', '26078237', '25815823', '25228255', '16261664', '26212401', '23905260', '20825664', '27345066', '25679242', '23076886', '26863627', '16373143', '26328795', '12750536', '15733717', '22874780', '21240137', '20220661']</td></tr><tr><td>27999377</td><td>An Interference-Aware Traffic-Priority-Based Link Scheduling Algorithm for Interference Mitigation in Multiple Wireless Body Area Networks.</td><td>['Le', 'Moh']</td><td>2016</td><td>Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)</td><td>Currently, wireless body area networks (WBANs) are effectively used for health monitoring services. However, in cases where WBANs are densely deployed, interference among WBANs can cause serious degradation of network performance and reliability. Inter-WBAN interference can be reduced by scheduling the communication links of interfering WBANs. In this paper, we propose an interference-aware traffic-priority-based link scheduling (ITLS) algorithm to overcome inter-WBAN interference in densely deployed WBANs. First, we model a network with multiple WBANs as an interference graph where node-level interference and traffic priority are taken into account. Second, we formulate link scheduling for multiple WBANs as an optimization model where the objective is to maximize the throughput of the entire network while ensuring the traffic priority of sensor nodes. Finally, we propose the ITLS algorithm for multiple WBANs on the basis of the optimization model. High spatial reuse is also achieved in the proposed ITLS algorithm. The proposed ITLS achieves high spatial reuse while considering traffic priority, packet length, and the number of interfered sensor nodes. Our simulation results show that the proposed ITLS significantly increases spatial reuse and network throughput with lower delay by mitigating inter-WBAN interference.</td><td>['Algorithms', 'Computer Communication Networks', 'Computer Simulation', 'Humans', 'Wireless Technology']</td><td>['21465185', '25903551', '26430285', '26110407', '20953680']</td></tr><tr><td>27999380</td><td>Cytoglobosins H and I, New Antiproliferative Cytochalasans from Deep-Sea-Derived Fungus Chaetomium globosum.</td><td>['Zhang', 'Min', 'Huang', 'Zhong', 'Wu', 'Li', 'Deng', 'Jiang', 'Shao', 'Zhang', 'He']</td><td>2016</td><td>Marine drugs</td><td>6 inhibited the growth of LNCaP cells by inducing apoptosis.</td><td>['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chaetomium', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fermentation', 'Humans', 'Indole Alkaloids', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Solid Phase Extraction']</td><td>['15497948', '15921417', '19597583', '26784209', '20225834', '23806112', '22130243', '16499339', '23678803', '15208404', '26837534', '7116505', '26213949', '22186592', '17636916']</td></tr><tr><td>27999381</td><td>Transcriptome Analysis to Understand the Toxicity of Latrodectus tredecimguttatus Eggs.</td><td>['Xu', 'Wang']</td><td>2016</td><td>Toxins</td><td>L. tredecimguttatus eggs, but also provides references for the further related researches.</td><td>['Animals', 'Arthropod Proteins', 'Black Widow Spider', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Ontology', 'Ovum', 'Toxins, Biological']</td><td>['23219381', '18508595', '24916504', '16101386', '19180666', '23020966', '22354971', '20421939', '26228472', '25785465', '25432940', '6705675', '18547439', '18824526', '24606830', '19799950', '22069579', '17881008', '19640225', '24412436', '21897427', '25730460', '16845012', '17029995', '24303891', '20210706', '25448392', '21715386', '524391', '23025922', '21572440', '21172403', '23324545', '24312294', '15688451', '24631373', '20644878', '15066411', '16081474', '18957441', '25406008', '19689420', '22858580', '18309778', '22771964', '2231712', '23225584', '16169031', '19879318', '8693328', '25027663', '21362584', '22741062', '22069711', '12440772', '18923708', '25622380', '25047904', '24412150', '21470368', '5166349', '25952364', '23266311', '23020618', '22543187', '22647711', '18508534', '6872847', '21156030', '15450924', '22069583', '22465017', '18972397', '23670823', '25835385', '20132535', '12651724', '12164782']</td></tr><tr><td>27999382</td><td>Comparative Study on Trace Element Excretions between Nonanuric and Anuric Patients Undergoing Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis.</td><td>['Xiang', 'Yao', 'Wan', 'Liang', 'Meng', 'Jin', 'Wu', 'Xu', 'Ying', 'Zuo']</td><td>2016</td><td>Nutrients</td><td>p < 0.010).

Mining such behavior features is essential to social analysis and business intelligence. However, the complexity and incompleteness of check-in records bring challenges to achieve such a task. Different from the previous work on social behavior analysis, in this paper, we present a visual analytics system, Social Check-in Fingerprinting (Sci-Fin), to facilitate the analysis and visualization of social check-in data. We focus on three major components of user check-in data: location, activity, and profile. Visual fingerprints for location, activity, and profile are designed to intuitively represent the high-dimensional attributes. To visually mine and demonstrate the behavior features, we integrate WorldMapper and Voronoi Treemap into our glyph-like designs.

This phenomenon occurs both between tumours (inter-tumour heterogeneity) and within tumours (intra-tumour heterogeneity), and it is caused by genetic and non-genetic factors. The heterogeneity of cancer cells introduces significant challenges in using molecular prognostic markers as well as for classifying patients that might benefit from specific therapies. Thus, research efforts for characterizing heterogeneity would be useful for a better understanding of the causes and progression of disease. It has been suggested that the study of heterogeneity within Circulating Tumour Cells (CTCs) could also reflect the full spectrum of mutations of the disease more accurately than a single biopsy of a primary or metastatic tumour. In previous years, many high throughput methodologies have raised for the study of heterogeneity at different levels (i.e., RNA, DNA, protein and epigenetic events). The aim of the current review is to stress clinical implications of tumour heterogeneity, as well as current available methodologies for their study, paying specific attention to those able to assess heterogeneity at the single cell level.</td><td>['Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'Phenotype', 'Single-Cell Analysis']</td><td>['25598437', '20631065', '25358515', '23471846', '25605225', '25222669', '24324171', '22356866', '22513401', '27083874', '21631906', '26575023', '26896446', '20944598', '25778307', '26180079', '27258547', '25599178', '25675209', '16892035', '17012833', '25639985', '25539732', '23233388', '25846554', '21964415', '21399628', '22016760', '23014601', '17362521', '18381931', '25425670', '18274524', '22258609', '21451512', '27034166', '23242437', '22078026', '23136247', '21655617', '18835035', '25233806', '26632267', '25398926', '26248267', '24145967', '25830880', '20339999', '26117829', '21376230', '11854519', '22281663', '25053837', '26374320', '21704837', '20959519', '27367729', '25133137', '22118458', '20543139', '24681997', '18227514', '19601617', '8875945', '25732828', '25307991', '23419522', '21248838', '20574808', '22959031', '22229245', '22469128', '25566504', '25398847', '25928070', '22665543', '24747642', '19812674', '11673243', '7112116', '24860595', '26410619', '22385958', '27070699', '26806412', '22673630', '12508244', '20177397', '25489582', '25858977', '18039110', '23844916', '10716967', '26301495', '22586443', '22614978', '22946317', '23299535', '25013076', '15521975', '21074720', '18423071', '27182557', '20485156', '25827447', '20101094', '25432738', '23704282', '25080805', '959840', '27091969', '17178751', '22173549', '26458175', '18784658', '23092187', '25003521', '22166544']</td></tr><tr><td>27999400</td><td>Cyclodextrins as Emerging Therapeutic Tools in the Treatment of Cholesterol-Associated Vascular and Neurodegenerative Diseases.</td><td>['Coisne', 'Tilloy', 'Monflier', 'Wils', 'Fenart', 'Gosselet']</td><td>2016</td><td>Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)</td><td>® CRYSMEB in atherosclerosis as well as with the 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) in clinical trials for Niemann-Pick type C disease.

Traditionally, apoptosis has been regarded as a cell-autonomous phenomenon. However, recent in vivo genetic studies have revealed that apoptotic cells actively influence the behaviors of surrounding cells, including engulfment, proliferation, and production of mechanical forces. Such interactions can be bidirectional, and apoptosis is non-autonomously induced in a cellular community. Of note, it is becoming evident that active communication between apoptotic cells and living cells contributes to physiological processes during tissue remodeling, regeneration, and morphogenesis. In this review, we focus on the mutual interactions between apoptotic cells and their neighbors in cellular society and discuss issues relevant to future studies of apoptosis.</td><td>['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Macrophages', 'Morphogenesis', 'Phagocytosis', 'Regeneration', 'Signal Transduction']</td><td>['10929712', '12719731', '23803955', '26657541', '17574031', '12702654', '11449278', '23842495', '25607361', '10200565', '16920621', '16645642', '18799722', '16980627', '20627080', '26898463', '26443630', '18802000', '17143268', '25874673', '19741708', '27177021', '19303855', '18329638', '15268856', '10499795', '11583623', '15066287', '18708583', '18362204', '22504180', '24121526', '23523355', '20211132', '20179271', '15066286', '11043402', '22992958', '23867226', '26884181', '24497843', '27185172', '12967562', '10675329', '15699212', '25621765', '26831070', '21402900', '6796636', '22504183', '10769037', '21693520', '10675328', '24561262', '11449279', '15302904', '7262460', '26293306', '1116643', '19686688', '27109213', '25199831', '26898471', '22855725', '9094312', '11961558', '11728307', '18331718', '17166923', '15469838', '15066191', '1752422', '12021770', '21389055', '18234181', '24496611', '20978240', '21555463', '8171319', '14634618', '21482673', '22250205', '15496444', '12065414', '23615608', '22162136', '19893571', '20832313', '26567213', '10617566', '19563763', '27212238']</td></tr><tr><td>27999404</td><td>Antioxidants and Dementia Risk: Consideration through a Cerebrovascular Perspective.</td><td>['Lam', 'Hackett', 'Takechi']</td><td>2016</td><td>Nutrients</td><td>A number of natural and chemical compounds that exert anti-oxidative properties are demonstrated to be beneficial for brain and cognitive function, and some are reported to reduce the risk of dementia. However, the detailed mechanisms by which those anti-oxidative compounds show positive effects on cognition and dementia are still unclear. An emerging body of evidence suggests that the integrity of the cerebrovascular blood-brain barrier (BBB) is centrally involved in the onset and progression of cognitive impairment and dementia. While recent studies revealed that some anti-oxidative agents appear to be protective against the disruption of BBB integrity and structure, few studies considered the neuroprotective effects of antioxidants in the context of cerebrovascular integrity. Therefore, in this review, we examine the mechanistic insights of antioxidants as a pleiotropic agent for cognitive impairment and dementia through a cerebrovascular axis by primarily focusing on the current available data from physiological studies. Conclusively, there is a compelling body of evidence that suggest antioxidants may prevent cognitive decline and dementia by protecting the integrity and function of BBB and, indeed, further studies are needed to directly examine these effects in addition to underlying molecular mechanisms.</td><td>['Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Capillary Permeability', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Dementia', 'Humans', 'Oxidative Stress']</td><td>['14732624', '20663047', '27588088', '10908610', '17724290', '21166677', '27535376', '20164568', '19565232', '23386786', '22654903', '21897213', '21499478', '12084801', '18640080', '24513285', '22173317', '17250680', '19896503', '17586731', '27309956', '26454022', '25780457', '25611508', '26683637', '23057687', '16888025', '26738349', '20826144', '27583652', '24740429', '20051973', '12076218', '24694235', '17207111', '22888398', '21728972', '22331300', '27038189', '14745459', '27662637', '27152411', '19534718', '27518088', '18387175', '17380553', '27243267', '19225804', '24399008', '24577081', '24424383', '26402759', '20472556', '27302542', '27422503', '20570121', '27382348', '25126203', '27657994', '23167559', '21811022', '25330860', '8700201', '25220346', '22785389', '25301691', '23799154', '23921899', '27774814', '25794165', '25796436', '16842945', '27357647', '25659514', '23652625', '25453776', '20858979', '9850871', '23782872', '24693279', '17982894', '26727124', '9674758', '20234382', '25534501', '25899606', '19804832', '12242084', '24397438', '27179961', '18931004', '19018244', '19241241', '18929509', '20625087', '26187557', '21091952', '23428737', '22144727', '21392094', '17303117', '25988948', '15485484', '21193043', '20496198', '11443025', '24973118', '27172148', '27068758', '16217125', '25869997', '12808450', '24432375', '22048062', '11462772', '25744566', '18565277', '18808450', '23930978', '24890126', '11794217', '22795384', '26374550', '19860996', '19524673', '21435338', '17848733', '25757756', '26673814', '26704648', '27634977', '9696409', '22451317', '20205647', '17510979', '22978403', '19236439', '19539642', '26708209', '24084218', '25792869', '26052727']</td></tr><tr><td>27999405</td><td>Neuroprotection via Reduction in Stress: Altered Menstrual Patterns as a Marker for Stress and Implications for Long-Term Neurologic Health in Women.</td><td>['Prokai', 'Berga']</td><td>2016</td><td>International journal of molecular sciences</td><td>Individuals under chronic psychological stress can be difficult to identify clinically. There is often no outwardly visible phenotype. Chronic stress of sufficient magnitude not only impacts reproductive function, but also concomitantly elicits a constellation of neuroendocrine changes that may accelerate aging in general and brain aging in particular. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, a phenotypically recognizable form of stress, is due to stress-induced suppression of endogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion. Reversal of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea includes restoration of ovulatory ovarian function and fertility and amelioration of hypercortisolism and hypothyroidism. Taken together, recovery from functional hypothalamic amenorrhea putatively offers neuroprotection and ameliorates stress-induced premature brain aging and possibly syndromic Alzheimer's disease. Amenorrhea may be viewed as a sentinel indicator of stress. Hypothalamic hypogonadism is less clinically evident in men and the diagnosis is difficult to establish. Whether there are other sex differences in the impact of stress on brain aging remains to be better investigated, but it is likely that both low estradiol from stress-induced anovulation and low testosterone from stress-induced hypogonadism compromise brain health.</td><td>['Aging', 'Amenorrhea', 'Anovulation', 'Estradiol', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypogonadism', 'Male', 'Menstruation', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases', 'Neuroprotection', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Stress, Psychological', 'Testosterone']</td><td>['11113609', '14581618', '17515892', '23459093', '23444138', '16891583', '3527687', '18037004', '19269917', '24203920', '24071819', '15891419', '8288706', '24064362', '25576134', '15879140', '2159970', '9589660', '3931190', '27196727', '2784314', '7631700', '9790402', '22542115', '3900122', '10411821', '22954078', '17716101', '17405827', '18086003', '23183181', '18292197', '9914629', '14672486', '18566676', '20591431', '17036175', '22761903', '24831823', '16464944', '11119695', '26041981', '15953801', '12764308', '9428819', '23843231', '14556820', '22348044', '3529965', '14702112', '9914630', '11358113', '17308138', '18574203', '8075786', '9176439', '11476778', '18286612', '20071463', '2493024', '23507474', '22215705', '25286385', '17440019']</td></tr><tr><td>27999406</td><td>Recent Advances in Stimuli-Responsive Release Function Drug Delivery Systems for Tumor Treatment.</td><td>['Ding', 'Tong', 'Feng', 'Fu']</td><td>2016</td><td>Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)</td><td>Benefiting from the development of nanotechnology, drug delivery systems (DDSs) with stimuli-responsive controlled release function show great potential in clinical anti-tumor applications.

An ideal DDS must firstly meet bio-safety standards and secondarily the efficiency-related demands of a large drug payload and controlled release function. This review highlights recent research progress on DDSs with stimuli-responsive characteristics. The first section briefly reviews the nanoscale scaffolds of DDSs, including mesoporous nanoparticles, polymers, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), quantum dots (QDs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs).

Medical care is mainly based on alleviating pain symptoms. Compelling studies report the presence of empty lacunae and hypocellularity in cartilage with aging and OA progression, suggesting that chondrocyte cell death occurs and participates to OA development. However, the relative contribution of apoptosis per se in OA pathogenesis appears complex to evaluate. Indeed, depending on technical approaches, OA stages, cartilage layers, animal models, as well as in vivo or in vitro experiments, the percentage of apoptosis and cell death types can vary. Apoptosis, chondroptosis, necrosis, and autophagic cell death are described in this review. The question of cell death causality in OA progression is also addressed, as well as the molecular pathways leading to cell death in response to the following inducers: Fas, Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), Tumor Necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), leptin, nitric oxide (NO) donors, and mechanical stresses. Furthermore, the protective role of autophagy in chondrocytes is highlighted, as well as its decline during OA progression, enhancing chondrocyte cell death; the transition being mainly controlled by HIF-1α/HIF-2α imbalance. Finally, we have considered whether interfering in chondrocyte apoptosis or promoting autophagy could constitute therapeutic strategies to impede OA progression.</td><td>['Aging', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Autophagy', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cartilage, Articular', 'Chondrocytes', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit', 'Interleukin-1beta', 'Leptin', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Osteoarthritis', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']</td><td>['27858200', '11518282', '24034904', '10782830', '3171180', '12667556', '20091349', '26342228', '21518315', '16385544', '27427985', '11315185', '19653858', '10891889', '12028657', '20147977', '26177004', '16621671', '20602810', '24225636', '21559479', '16759941', '10979876', '23908112', '18055478', '22147463', '11840442', '7856740', '23979019', '26254227', '16151643', '22168390', '18782442', '16492401', '1658153', '19333945', '10657679', '19770840', '7537695', '14656672', '10200555', '26528972', '10855892', '12565700', '14613274', '11562122', '23134577', '18314051', '17907423', '23994836', '12018969', '11803371', '3264290', '26492575', '26751999', '23438821', '26094910', '14555214', '26805019', '22087763', '21869830', '18311796', '18457608', '20131282', '25469820', '14566967', '19684582', '15004016', '23606170', '11714388', '11101870', '25336110', '19139663', '3127099', '25605458', '27492463', '12954239', '4561027', '16950166', '7923921', '16912423', '15023385', '12913938', '16859932', '25573665', '7325464', '6193331', '11904147', '11465715', '10419776', '19830459', '19404942', '26081683', '23324280', '9550474', '26878072', '9501089', '9566531', '14558093', '11032407', '9184224', '19217321', '2589219', '27247228', '24126970', '10902761', '18785318', '15261346', '9501221', '21181091', '10222216', '26074364', '25045687', '19583961', '26806183', '24651621', '19950295', '24025112', '26549531', '17305511', '22975756', '16200202', '11100732', '11278768', '11859412', '12610816', '26936086', '10982649', '10620704', '16977332', '25553838', '10802706', '1466599', '15654015', '21590680', '19008124', '9180333', '19802558', '15450003', '27308513', '18250111', '23894471', '25708836', '9751096', '12480916', '26450708', '19494318', '10430184', '12210057', '26934480', '19292938', '11728217', '12210056', '17786965', '9663485', '23326413', '23386193', '14568942', '1545126', '26184498', '9823004', '15647429', '26706703', '19822235', '19095472', '16960943', '11879535', '20058262', '9336406', '9433695', '12949404', '19725096', '26947886', '22095691', '20639872', '11795990', '10356417', '22143896', '23620164', '21135882', '11407689', '18576323', '26520447', '27483042', '24343796', '11779095', '25748615', '8106557', '23725295', '21351054', '11212181', '22084394', '22507670', '14504917', '15183429', '20439458', '17492650', '22154936', '9422506', '10403282', '9014865', '19434061', '11689560', '11965488', '12752665', '14872493', '24939082', '9299161', '7529496', '9485086', '27605110', '11930008', '11087699', '15800624', '26438374', '26660640', '18096078', '15258458', '15501408', '25001340', '23776697', '11003576', '9779827', '17562483', '15240564', '12938158', '20495569', '18054255', '17404735', '11178118', '7737654', '10685814', '27390029', '27118398', '26132523', '19802560', '21760595', '27590063', '22034068', '27447821', '12209500', '10440927', '17159184', '27716396', '7513156', '26068954', '20811353', '20518074', '12766758', '21324370', '16469115', '17075858', '26711691', '16625636', '27475664', '11691837', '17525752', '26494484', '19258318', '26318657', '15480081', '23603903', '11264462', '16172382', '17224629', '8408001', '10975859', '16368252', '20187128', '16736522', '25982995', '8619377', '24347567', '15708893', '9663486', '9126928']</td></tr><tr><td>27999411</td><td>Transspecies Transmission of Gammaretroviruses and the Origin of the Gibbon Ape Leukaemia Virus (GaLV) and the Koala Retrovirus (KoRV).</td><td>['Denner']</td><td>2016</td><td>Viruses</td><td>Melomys burtoni, the Australian and Indonesian grassland melomys.

Therefore, given the fact that the habitats of the gibbons in Thailand and the koalas in Australia are far away, and that bats are able to fly over long distances, the hypothesis that retroviruses of bats are the origin of GaLV and KoRV deserves consideration.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Healthy male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were chosen and divided into a normal control group (n=15) and a shock model group (n=27) that received intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Then, 3 specimens were taken from each group. The shock model group rats were divided into an LPS group and a treatment group with 12 rats each. The treatment group received intravenous injection of compound sodium lactate solution. Plasma IMD and IMD1-47 mRNA expressions were compared and analyzed. RESULTS Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was lower while white blood cell count and TNF-α were higher in the shock model group than in the normal control group (P<0.05). After 10 h and 20 h, the treatment group had lower plasma IMD and IMD1-47 mRNA expressions compared with the LPS group (P<0.05). Plasma IMD and IMD1-47 mRNA expressions in the LPS group after 20 h were significantly higher than after 10 h (P<0.05). IMD was positively correlated with interleukins (IL-3, IL-6, and IL-8), white blood cell count, and body temperature (all P<0.05), but were negatively correlated with systolic pressure (r=-0.8474, P=0.0040).

Prospective community-acquired S. aureus SSTI surveillance was conducted in 23 hospitals over a 24-month period. Susceptibility to 16 antimicrobials was evaluated using the agar dilution method. StatApriori was used to determine statistically significant association trends. The genotypic characteristics of CA-MRSA isolates were tested by staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, staphylococcal protein A (spa) typing, and multilocus sequence typing. The presence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (pvl) genes was determined. Overall, 71.6% (1946/2716) of cases were community-associated S. aureus. CA-MRSA accounted for 2.6% (51). Out of 1895 methicillin-sensitive S. aureus strains, 97.3% were resistant to erythromycin, 96.6% to penicillin and 89.1% to clindamycin. No S. aureus strains were resistant to vancomycin. Thirteen sequence types (STs) and 17 spa types were detected among the CA-MRSA strains. The most prevalent sequence type was ST121 (19/51, 37.3%), followed by ST59 (13/51, 25.5%). In addition, t437 was predominant, accounting for 43.1% (22/51). Only five (9.8%) of the CA-MRSA strains harbored pvl genes. There were no significant differences in antibiotic sensitivity profiles between ST121 and non-ST121 MRSA isolates. However, ST121 strains tended to be more resistant to cefazolin, whereas non-ST121 strains were more resistant to chloramphenicol. In conclusion, CA-MRSA infections are rare among Chinese SSTI patients. MRSA strains in China have diverse genetic backgrounds, with ST121 being the predominant clone. Fusidic acid and mupirocin remain effective for topical treatment.</td><td>['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China', 'Community-Acquired Infections', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Epidemiological Monitoring', 'Exotoxins', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukocidins', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Typing', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Soft Tissue Infections', 'Staphylococcal Skin Infections', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Virulence Factors', 'Young Adult']</td><td>['26445995', '22701673', '19721075', '19675670', '21533238', '22066960', '23177275', '15963278', '16207977', '19593449', '11888633', '18053175', '19754868', '25161186', '20227225', '21807550', '12044378', '20206987', '20132304', '20610826', '26408338', '12491202', '16207957', '22187567', '18190580', '20404122', '14766855', '18718557', '10698988', '26856837', '2886836', '24391040']</td></tr><tr><td>27999416</td><td>Polyphyletic origin of MERS coronaviruses and isolation of a novel clade A strain from dromedary camels in the United Arab Emirates.</td><td>['Lau', 'Wernery', 'Wong', 'Joseph', 'Tsang', 'Patteril', 'Elizabeth', 'Chan', 'Muhammed', 'Kinne', 'Yuen', 'Wernery', 'Woo']</td><td>2016</td><td>Emerging microbes & infections</td><td>Little is known regarding the molecular epidemiology of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) circulating in dromedaries outside Saudi Arabia. To address this knowledge gap, we sequenced 10 complete genomes of MERS-CoVs isolated from 2 live and 8 dead dromedaries from different regions in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Phylogenetic analysis revealed one novel clade A strain, the first detected in the UAE, and nine clade B strains. Strain D998/15 had a distinct phylogenetic position within clade A, being more closely related to the dromedary isolate NRCE-HKU205 from Egypt than to the human isolates EMC/2012 and Jordan-N3/2012. A comparison of predicted protein sequences also demonstrated the existence of two clade A lineages with unique amino acid substitutions, A1 (EMC/2012 and Jordan-N3/2012) and A2 (D998/15 and NRCE-HKU205), circulating in humans and camels, respectively. The nine clade B isolates belong to three distinct lineages: B1, B3 and B5. Two B3 strains, D1271/15 and D1189.1/15, showed evidence of recombination between lineages B4 and B5 in ORF1ab. Molecular clock analysis dated the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of clade A to March 2011 and that of clade B to November 2011. Our data support a polyphyletic origin of MERS-CoV in dromedaries and the co-circulation of diverse MERS-CoVs including recombinant strains in the UAE.</td><td>['Animals', 'Camelus', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Coronavirus Infections', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome, Viral', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Phylogeny', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology', 'United Arab Emirates']</td><td>['25552712', '26269185', '27528677', '24206838', '16809319', '23720729', '16169905', '23075143', '26632876', '15613317', '24857749', '16195424', '24896817', '25211075', '26676406', '24079378', '26792741', '26350969', '23933067', '24655427', '26678874', '24131722', '25810418', '24055451', '20702646', '24856660', '24355866', '23986593', '12958366', '9557750', '16647731', '21849456', '26981708', '17121802', '23170002', '25114257', '26132767', '26404138', '25989145', '17996036']</td></tr><tr><td>27999417</td><td>First documented case of avian influenza (H5N1) virus infection in a lion.</td><td>['Chen', 'Wang', 'Zhao', 'Ma', 'Wang', 'Lei', 'Li', 'Yang', 'Chen', 'Chen', 'Li', 'Jin', 'Li', 'Liu', 'Xu', 'Wong', 'Liu', 'Liu', 'Shi', 'Bi', 'Gao']</td><td>2016</td><td>Emerging microbes & infections</td><td>null</td><td>['Animals', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Genome, Viral', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype', 'Lions', 'Lung', 'Male', 'Orthomyxoviridae Infections', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Viral', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology']</td><td>['26259704', '19225004', '15663858', '26082035', '27405930', '25461692', '16140781', '24483237', '27162026']</td></tr><tr><td>27999418</td><td>A camel-derived MERS-CoV with a variant spike protein cleavage site and distinct fusion activation properties.</td><td>['Millet', 'Goldstein', 'Labitt', 'Hsu', 'Daniel', 'Whittaker']</td><td>2016</td><td>Emerging microbes & infections</td><td>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to circulate in both humans and camels, and the origin and evolution of the virus remain unclear. Here we characterize the spike protein of a camel-derived MERS-CoV (NRCE-HKU205) identified in 2013, early in the MERS outbreak. NRCE-HKU205 spike protein has a variant cleavage motif with regard to the S2' fusion activation site-notably, a novel substitution of isoleucine for the otherwise invariant serine at the critical P1' cleavage site position. The substitutions resulted in a loss of furin-mediated cleavage, as shown by fluorogenic peptide cleavage and western blot assays. Cell-cell fusion and pseudotyped virus infectivity assays demonstrated that the S2' substitutions decreased spike-mediated fusion and viral entry. However, cathepsin and trypsin-like protease activation were retained, albeit with much reduced efficiency compared with the prototypical EMC/2012 human strain. We show that NRCE-HKU205 has more limited fusion activation properties possibly resulting in more restricted viral tropism and may represent an intermediate in the complex pattern of MERS-CoV ecology and evolution.</td><td>['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Camelus', 'Cell Line', 'Furin', 'Humans', 'Isoleucine', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Proteolysis', 'Serine', 'Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus', 'Virus Internalization']</td><td>['24964193', '26935699', '24257604', '26855426', '26527717', '24027332', '24217413', '24098509', '19439480', '23763835', '27344959', '26814649', '26678874', '23486063', '22355773', '24856660', '25031349', '25375324', '12615904', '23170002', '25288733', '19321428', '26958908', '14985543', '25062254', '23468491']</td></tr><tr><td>27999424</td><td>Targeting cancer-related inflammation in the era of immunotherapy.</td><td>['Nakamura', 'Smyth']</td><td>2017</td><td>Immunology and cell biology</td><td>Recent advances in cancer immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint blockade therapy have dramatically changed the therapeutic strategy against advanced malignancies. Still, only a subset of patients shows a good response to any single therapy. Moreover, it remains largely unsolved how we can maintain durable clinical responses, or how we can successfully treat a broader range of cancers by immunotherapy. Growing evidence suggests that the major barrier to more successful cancer immunotherapy is the tumour microenvironment (TME), where chronic inflammation has a predominant role in tumour survival and proliferation, angiogenesis and immunosuppression. Over the past decades, our understanding of cancer-related inflammation has significantly evolved, and now we have various therapeutic options tailored to the TME. These therapeutic strategies include inhibiting inflammatory mediators or their downstream signalling molecules, blocking the recruitment of myeloid cells, modulating immunosuppressive functions in myeloid cells and re-educating the TME. In this review, we discuss the role of cancer-related inflammation as a potential target in the era of immunotherapy.</td><td>['Animals', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunotherapy', 'Inflammation', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Neoplasms', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Escape', 'Tumor Microenvironment']</td><td>['25432409', '18026089', '22575588', '24589924', '10830965', '15475440', '26582900', '19674190', '20484019', '12407406', '26027717', '19136477', '26911188', '20192808', '18612415', '27027486', '23920127', '17616668', '25320361', '23570800', '13404306', '21665146', '21088683', '26343581', '26872698', '23050968', '20303878', '23429495', '26598942', '24162378', '14996724', '24563479', '24833354', '21219185', '26325033', '23752227', '24058788', '16135466', '26105538', '25035124', '20813259', '19343034', '22039576', '22907596', '15542429', '26801219', '27298414', '27634762', '27179037', '17101732', '24642471', '19798027', '27662089', '18809714', '23157435', '20842130', '23477736', '19181644', '22187483', '18820689', '11229684', '22869585', '19468060', '21263073', '26451326', '23987103', '19308068', '25754329', '25505970', '27642729', '25784597', '17925549', '18802069', '25717063', '26868177', '24215318', '22698407', '12566320', '24292632', '26121197', '25314077', '18650914', '6758376', '15380516', '27433843', '20087353', '23460534', '22035839', '24572365', '22435567', '26216383']</td></tr><tr><td>27999425</td><td>Insane in the membrane: a structural perspective of MLKL function in necroptosis.</td><td>['Petrie', 'Hildebrand', 'Murphy']</td><td>2017</td><td>Immunology and cell biology</td><td>Necroptosis (or 'programmed necrosis') is a caspase-independent cell death pathway that operates downstream of death receptors, including Tumour Necrosis Factor Receptor-1 (TNFR1), and the Toll-like receptors, TLR3 and TLR4.

Only over the past 7 years has the core machinery of this pathway, the receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) and the pseudokinase, Mixed Lineage Kinase domain-Like (MLKL), been defined. Our current understanding of the pathway is that RIPK3-mediated phosphorylation activates cytoplasmic MLKL, which is the most terminal known effector in the pathway, leading to MLKL's oligomerisation, translocation to, and permeabilisation of, the plasma membrane.

In spite of the high prevalence of these viral infections in humans, only a small proportion of these individuals who may have an underlying immune defect develop malignant disease. Furthermore, many of these viruses have evolved unique mechanisms to avoid the host immune system to successfully establish latent infection with limited gene expression. Technological advances in delineating the role of cellular immune responses in the control of viral infections and ability to rapidly expand these effector cells in vitro have provided an important platform for the development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies to treat virus-associated cancers. While autologous T cell therapies have provided promising results, development of 'off-the-shelf' third-party allogeneic virus-specific T cell therapies have emerged as powerful tools to treat many of the virus-associated diseases.

These breakthroughs have transformed the way we understand NPC structure, and they provide an important base for functional investigations, including the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying clinically manifested mutations of the nucleocytoplasmic transport system.</td><td>['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Pore', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins']</td><td>['2190694', '7638906', '2184032', '23511206', '25942622', '25494300', '3072197', '27091992', '26485283', '26411495', '26423234', '26137436', '11029043', '22770730', '2738089', '18611384', '20550937', '19525551', '14624840', '14532109', '25288112', '12196509', '25938906', '26878725', '24062435', '19641729', '26160949', '8422679', '26705895', '21189294', '9159086', '24632227', '24530809', '8521485', '10611974', '25822992', '26849307', '11290711', '26791760', '25646085', '9463388', '7739040', '15657394', '16682526', '16361228', '21803848', '19706512', '8045926', '1385442', '19019988', '21499242', '2437126', '21502404', '1469043', '21321608', '26344569', '20385085', '1055359', '1464327', '26316600', '26051542', '9015297', '26025361', '17851530', '23795296', '20407419', '18046406', '21335236', '8276887', '21495847', '26891179', '10976230', '7878057', '19414609', '24574455', '26416747', '3086323', '15502822', '10684247', '24315095', '3518946', '17916694', '25146397', '12496130', '21305702', '7721756', '15523559', '15837182', '8130038', '25171412', '26944195', '17220896', '2050741', '26791761', '14786306', '11352933', '11823431', '9348540', '8565072', '25745173', '18112254', '26614874', '26456112', '15229283', '7688296', '2442757', '14570049', '26008788', '26292704', '9067593', '25054937', '15039779', '24927568', '7828598', '21930948', '9843582', '22632834', '27081072', '3110163', '2446896', '26402457', '9323134', '19503077', '22036567', '23845946', '21964414', '7153248', '8314837', '26112706', '24657998', '9822603', '13056596', '21030234', '22960634', '27081075', '15514115', '3335228', '986398', '2101351', '13843146', '27623381', '12191480', '27013428', '12684002', '24857732', '27136131', '24637836', '27374333', '3064988', '14353112', '19111661', '21970986', '12490173', '7068761', '23962805', '21784248', '27016207', '26366573', '16120647', '2324201', '26046439', '2112428', '12705868', '17082456', '24165936', '24480294', '3313397', '26633879', '1725493', '21242077', '22555605', '8413630', '24857728', '25139911', '25797490', '8001116', '18046405', '15557116', '8227139', '1617726', '3805121', '27013426', '18206968']</td></tr><tr><td>27999430</td><td>Necroptosis in development, inflammation and disease.</td><td>['Weinlich', 'Oberst', 'Beere', 'Green']</td><td>2017</td><td>Nature reviews.

NMR analyses and site-directed mutagenesis studies using the osmo-sensing EnvZ, a prototypical HK of E. coli, showed that waldiomycin directly binds to both H-box and X-region, which are the two conserved regions in the dimerization-inducing and histidine-containing phosphotransfer (DHp) domain of HKs. Waldiomycin inhibits phosphorylation of the conserved histidine in the H-box. Analysis of waldiomycin derivatives suggests that the angucyclic ring, situated near the H-box in the waldiomycin-EnvZ DHp domain complex model, is responsible for the inhibitory activity. We demonstrate that waldiomycin is an HK inhibitor binding to the H-box region and has the potential of inhibiting a broad spectrum of HKs.</td><td>['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Escherichia coli', 'Escherichia coli Proteins', 'Histidine Kinase', 'Models, Structural', 'Multienzyme Complexes', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphorylation', 'Quinones']</td><td>['9721293', '25531939', '15318002', '2032948', '24048521', '8520220', '17628150', '22526318', '17094812', '20138000', '21853073', '26582287', '24782522', '19800110', '1662380', '10966457', '1620493', '23632918', '5674372', '23333741', '23746806', '20057515', '5459625', '17636449', '10426948', '18440021', '10637609', '10564504', '9817206', '27173778']</td></tr><tr><td>27999432</td><td>Antibacterial effect of antibiotic-loaded SBA-15 on biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis.</td><td>['Aguilar-Colomer', 'Doadrio', 'Pérez-Jorge', 'Manzano', 'Vallet-Regí', 'Esteban']</td><td>2017</td><td>The Journal of antibiotics</td><td>Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are human pathogens involved in implant-related infections.

A statistically significant decrease in the biofilm density and the number of viable bacteria was detected for all antibiotics at 6 h in both bacteria. Rifampin showed an increase in the biofilm density and the number of viable bacteria at 24 h. No differences were detected between Vancomycin and the combination of antibiotics. S. epidermidis was more sensitive to the effect of the antibiotics than S. aureus.

The cationic charge in their structures has a strong correlation with antimicrobial activity, being responsible for the initial electrostatic interaction between peptides and the anionic microbial surface. This paper contains evidence that charge modification in the neutral peptide Gm cecropin D-like (WT) improved the antimicrobial activity of the modified peptides. Two cationic peptides derived from WT sequence named as ΔM1 and ΔM2, with net charge of +5 and +9, respectively, showed at least an eightfold increase in their antimicrobial activity in comparison to WT. The mechanism of action of these peptides was investigated using small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) as model membranes. To study permeabilization effects of the peptides on cell membranes, entrapped calcein liposomes were used and the results showed that all peptides induced calcein release from 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG) SUVs, whereas in 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), POPC/POPG and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE)/POPG SUVs, only ΔM1 and ΔM2 induced a notable permeabilization. In addition, interactions of these peptides with phospholipids at the level of the glycerol backbone and hydrophobic domain were studied through observed changes in generalized polarization and fluorescence anisotropy using probes such as Laurdan and DPH, respectively. The results suggest that peptides slightly ordered the bilayer structure at the level of glycerol backbone and on the hydrophobic core in 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DMPG) SUVs, whereas in 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC)/DMPG SUVs, only ΔM1 and ΔM2 peptides increased the order of bilayers. Thus, peptides would be inducing clustering of phospholipids creating phospholipid domains with a higher phase transition temperature.</td><td>['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides', 'Bacteria', 'Cell Membrane', 'Fluoresceins', 'Hemolysis', 'Humans', 'Liposomes', 'Membrane Fluidity', 'Membranes, Artificial', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Moths', 'Peptides', 'Phosphatidylcholines', 'Phosphatidylglycerols', 'Phospholipids']</td><td>['10675500', '17194500', '8494972', '22433675', '23877962', '20858205', '15697236', '2005621', '6722106', '22253439', '20617807', '10426426', '18274517', '11807545', '20599683', '11683882', '23838623', '16857174', '15019200', '15677462', '22245454', '15019199', '18826221', '16678118', '23159483', '3961484', '12615953', '18098173']</td></tr><tr><td>27999439</td><td>FGG Gene Polymorphisms in Morbidly Obese Patients.</td><td>['Kupcinskiene', 'Murnikovaite', 'Varkalaite', 'Juzenas', 'Trepenaitis', 'Petereit', 'Maleckas', 'Kupcinskas', 'Macas']</td><td>2016</td><td>Disease markers</td><td>FGG C>T (rs6536024) were not associated with height, weight, or morbid obesity among European subjects.</td><td>['ABO Blood-Group System', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Factor V', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity, Morbid', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Thrombosis']</td><td>['21527750', '20231535', '25656610', '24092932', '24156506', '19739036', '21655679', '25653872', '17167477', '26217629', '26354877', '23650146', '25422209', '25627967', '25458833', '17217642', '25449138', '25503145', '26565658', '22825588', '11038326', '21980494', '26597668', '16144795', '17701901', '25103961', '17849041', '7920641', '25756913', '20031578', '25161014', '25472531', '25391732', '25772935', '19278955', '25511577', '24480950', '23381943', '25118907']</td></tr><tr><td>27999440</td><td>The Ratio of Hmox1/Nrf2 mRNA Level in the Tumor Tissue Is a Predictor of Distant Metastasis in Colorectal Cancer.</td><td>['Chang', 'Fan', 'Tseng', 'Chein', 'Hsieh', 'Chen', 'Hwang', 'Hua']</td><td>2016</td><td>Disease markers</td><td>Heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1) plays an important role in the growth and spread of tumor, and its expression is regulated positively by Nrf2 [nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2; NFE2L2] and negatively by kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and by BTB and CNC homology 1 (Bach1).

The mRNA level of Hmox1 in the tumor tissue of CRC is not correlated with that of the Nrf2 pathway molecules, and its ratio to the Nrf2 level may be useful for suggesting distant metastasis in CRC.</td><td>['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins', 'Female', 'Heme Oxygenase-1', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'RNA, Messenger']</td><td>['15520857', '15519281', '21412018', '26697129', '22325485', '24383403', '22484561', '19949014', '22286106', '9887101', '21164525', '25107906', '24395801', '23109674', '20215646', '14524534', '23483479', '15863380', '24692350', '24642471', '24200599', '26117320', '23434765', '26216839', '17179102', '22641035', '17558910', '19658179', '20704546', '21530747', '24927633', '24180287', '19608619', '18838122', '17822372', '16601269', '27052415']</td></tr><tr><td>27999441</td><td>Association between Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Polymorphisms and Age-Related Macular Degeneration: An Updated Meta-Analysis.</td><td>['Barchitta', 'Maugeri']</td><td>2016</td><td>Disease markers</td><td>VEGF polymorphisms in the risk of AMD.

Hepatocellular damage owing to liver injury leads to the release of profibrotic factors from infiltrating inflammatory cells that results in the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Upon activation, HSCs undergo characteristic morphological and functional changes and are transformed into proliferative and contractile ECM-producing myofibroblasts. Over recent years, a number of therapeutic strategies have been developed to inhibit hepatocyte apoptosis, inflammatory responses, and HSCs proliferation and activation. Preclinical studies have yielded numerous targets for the development of antifibrotic therapies, some of which have entered clinical trials and showed improved therapeutic efficacy and desirable safety profiles. Furthermore, advancements have been made in the development of noninvasive markers and techniques for the accurate disease assessment and therapy responses. Here, we focus on the clinical developments attained in the field of targeted antifibrotics for the treatment of liver fibrosis, for example, small molecule drugs, antibodies, and targeted drug conjugate. We further briefly highlight different noninvasive diagnostic technologies and will provide an overview about different therapeutic targets, clinical trials, endpoints, and translational efforts that have been made to halt or reverse the progression of liver fibrosis.</td><td>['Animals', 'Disease Progression', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Hepatic Stellate Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Models, Biological']</td><td>['21511916', '19117990', '20129924', '19913614', '20148709', '18096196', '22226772', '27663656', '25626988', '20032142', '26549695', '18471441', '21748765', '22389428', '20855789', '22440008', '21254182', '15314020', '25568860', '25453965', '25531162', '18692530', '25587629', '14691287', '27171020', '25674381', '16543289', '18077624', '22262739', '21794086', '22878469', '26314479', '19255851', '19137587', '20818376', '27324199', '24130706', '22634342', '20811384', '17138861', '12512034', '16798724', '12845617', '27563019', '25996799', '19243014', '21104934', '18242211', '24612021', '21168455', '26636929', '15574354', '27207019', '19017551', '20004661', '16136555', '23523583', '23347838', '21136163', '26284818', '18161483', '21074585', '15690074', '18984462', '26022693', '25388537', '19393271', '27169903', '15521018', '26977760', '21247219', '27363528', '27239119', '26921091', '16439617', '20175029', '26435270', '19081665', '22032637', '20427778', '15793283', '23441194', '18376398', '27682648', '18334275', '21442374', '19603542', '10930382', '26834633', '15183724', '16549783', '20439985', '14647056', '18973848', '24296297', '22387320', '24677197', '15269313', '23001208', '10833490', '19628656', '22504185', '19554540', '25468160', '26560734', '24917820', '18662740', '26426402', '14550642', '19054629', '16447288', '21538439', '23884859', '19441102', '19060630', '17567477', '17663771', '11385966', '25562318', '16023247', '23847292', '25991488', '22364262', '16936262', '12858535', '12385448', '21800888', '16139919', '16466667', '17245650', '17106243', '17510318', '17567829', '27291657', '26820053', '19128254', '21383021', '20924568', '26524530', '26447669', '19012043', '11721762', '11584368', '25911335']</td></tr><tr><td>27999464</td><td>The Relation between the Fear-Avoidance Model and Constructs from the Social Cognitive Theory in Acute WAD.</td><td>['Sandborgh', 'Johansson', 'Söderlund']</td><td>2016</td><td>Pain research & management</td><td>p < 0.001.

These studies have demonstrated that the transcription of Arc is activated in selective groups of frontal cortical neurons in response to specific behavioral tasks. Arc expression regulates the persistent firing of individual neurons and predicts the consolidation of neuronal ensembles during repeated learning. Therefore, the Arc pathway represents a prototypical example of activity-dependent genetic feedback regulation of neuronal ensembles. The activation of this pathway in the frontal cortex starts during early postnatal development and requires dopaminergic (DA) input. Conversely, genetic disruption of Arc leads to a hypoactive mesofrontal dopamine circuit and its related cognitive deficit. This mutual interaction suggests an auto-regulatory mechanism to amplify the impact of neuromodulators and activity-regulated genes during postnatal development. Such a mechanism may contribute to the association of mutations in dopamine and Arc pathways with neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders. As the mesofrontal dopamine circuit shows extensive activity-dependent developmental plasticity, activity-guided modulation of DA projections or Arc ensembles during development may help to repair circuit deficits related to neuropsychiatric disorders.</td><td>['Animals', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'Dopamine', 'Feedback, Physiological', 'Frontal Lobe', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Learning', 'Mice', 'Motor Activity', 'Nerve Net', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins']</td><td>['17088212', '7857651', '16740581', '15242609', '18714326', '26958833', '24429629', '24995986', '22083728', '26051420', '24094104', '21278731', '23528911', '20228806', '27365296', '17015235', '17088211', '25031392', '26985722', '18036810', '7722525', '19555290', '16871537', '19008936', '11394996', '26987258', '17981809', '24569488', '3361004', '18938224', '20339051', '24309249', '24806683', '16239477', '24463507', '18835649', '23152606', '22078504', '20221886', '21068826', '26774694', '20729843', '7777577', '17088213', '11466419', '10499792', '10698012', '26154978', '15082022', '16272112', '24679536', '26134320', '15217899', '26232228', '10804226', '23866325', '25866352', '23040805', '16309746', '20826307', '26352471', '15474169', '19325164', '25622573', '25233312', '10570490', '24695228', '27524619', '26289572', '21601615', '17408759', '12777258', '22538608', '16150584', '26335640', '19543222', '24463508', '26474411', '22584581', '25864631', '24805237', '3749894', '23329071', '22681690', '22078506', '16873068', '6182953', '24855953', '25651194', '15381316', '16885228']</td></tr><tr><td>27999581</td><td>Annealing Ant Colony Optimization with Mutation Operator for Solving TSP.</td><td>['Mohsen']</td><td>2016</td><td>Computational intelligence and neuroscience</td><td>Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) has been successfully applied to solve a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems such as minimum spanning tree, traveling salesman problem, and quadratic assignment problem.

Therefore, this paper proposed a hybrid ACO algorithm integrating the advantages of ACO, SA, mutation operator, and local search procedure to solve the traveling salesman problem. The core of algorithm is based on the ACO. SA and mutation operator were used to increase the ants population diversity from time to time and the local search was used to exploit the current search area efficiently. The comparative experiments, using 24 TSP instances from TSPLIB, show that the proposed algorithm outperformed some well-known algorithms in the literature in terms of solution quality.</td><td>['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Ants', 'Ecology', 'Models, Biological', 'Population Dynamics', 'Stochastic Processes']</td><td>['17813860', '18263004', '21324786']</td></tr><tr><td>27999602</td><td>Poisson Mixture Regression Models for Heart Disease Prediction.</td><td>['Mufudza', 'Erol']</td><td>2016</td><td>Computational and mathematical methods in medicine</td><td>Early heart disease control can be achieved by high disease prediction and diagnosis efficiency.

Analysis and application of Poisson mixture regression models is here addressed under two different classes: standard and concomitant variable mixture regression models. Results show that a two-component concomitant variable Poisson mixture regression model predicts heart disease better than both the standard Poisson mixture regression model and the ordinary general linear Poisson regression model due to its low Bayesian Information Criteria value. Furthermore, a Zero Inflated Poisson Mixture Regression model turned out to be the best model for heart prediction over all models as it both clusters individuals into high or low risk category and predicts rate to heart disease componentwise given clusters available. It is deduced that heart disease prediction can be effectively done by identifying the major risks componentwise using Poisson mixture regression model.</td><td>['Algorithms', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors']</td><td>['24352519', '26353243', '9185291']</td></tr><tr><td>27999612</td><td>SEPT9 is a potential biomarker for minimally invasive diagnosis in adenocarcinomas of the biliary tract.</td><td>['Branchi', 'Schaefer', 'Semaan', 'Kania', 'Lingohr', 'Kalff', 'Schäfer', 'Kristiansen', 'Dietrich', 'Matthaei']</td><td>2016</td><td>Clinical epigenetics</td><td>SEPT9 gene loci in BTC.</td><td>['Adenocarcinoma', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biliary Tract Neoplasms', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation', 'Early Detection of Cancer', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Prospective Studies', 'Septins']</td><td>['23866788', '24395070', '21426551', '21547707', '16136652', '25675432', '19763613', '21562580', '9482898', '22108652', '24936140', '24136974', '11846609', '26421820', '23555160', '12738733', '25652468', '12042769', '21047392', '22168215', '18089654', '22446083', '26551297', '21740328', '24089088', '17647056', '24581682', '19406918', '21808282', '22555092', '21694641', '23971898', '11391522', '17550320', '25066711', '21933219', '17481601', '15495264', '19245868', '23378539', '23988185', '25988180', '25644509', '21460876', '24026539', '22307400', '15467712', '24925595', '23990466', '9858825', '23408352', '22794276', '26937257', '21876633', '24367375', '24386354', '24002901', '26742998', '18995218', '23540689', '15286780', '22983262', '18559491']</td></tr><tr><td>27999673</td><td>When Women with Cystic Fibrosis Become Mothers: Psychosocial Impact and Adjustments.</td><td>['Cammidge', 'Duff', 'Latchford', 'Etherington']</td><td>2016</td><td>Pulmonary medicine</td><td>postpartum adjustment to CF care.</td><td>['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Family Planning Services', 'Female', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Health Status Disparities', 'Humans', 'Life Expectancy', 'Mothers', 'Patient Care Team', 'Patient Compliance', 'Patient Preference', 'Perinatal Care', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality Improvement', 'Social Support', 'United Kingdom']</td><td>['22369117', '12903696', '18692444', '15066113', '19492208', '18024241', '9104667', '11050265', '18783860', '21631440', '10532145', '20205575', '16435526', '17498171', '18718108', '6880820', '23143792', '21637348', '10724748', '18191768', '16025763', '16537871', '22049387', '15210264', '16356610', '17301339', '1559146', '21473755']</td></tr><tr><td>27999678</td><td>POU4F3 Gene Causes Autosomal Dominant Hearing Loss.</td><td>['Zhang', 'Wang', 'Xiao', 'Zhang', 'Zhou', 'Li', 'Zheng', 'Bai', 'Wang']</td><td>2016</td><td>Neural plasticity</td><td>POU4F3 is necessary for the genetic diagnosis of hereditary hearing loss in the future.</td><td>['Asian Continental Ancestry Group', 'Codon, Nonsense', 'Female', 'Hearing Loss', 'Hearing Loss, Sensorineural', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Transcription Factor Brn-3C']</td><td>['28698811', '24556497', '8637595', '7052898', '14585957', '26974322', '9506947', '25250959', '27247933', '24681721', '18347256', '15254021', '20434433', '7623109', '27066914', '22938506', '19372648', '18414213', '15465029', '25372459', '25122905', '17331196', '23767834', '12811000', '10452377', '25388789', '9256502', '18228599', '24260153', '25904789', '9735355', '8352967']</td></tr><tr><td>27999758</td><td>Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infection in Mice.</td><td>['Pan', 'Tan', 'Li', 'Liu', 'Wang', 'Tian', 'Liu', 'Qu']</td><td>2016</td><td>Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology</td><td>P. aeruginosa infection.

Nevertheless, the risk of reoperation reaches 9%. There is no consensus as to the best treatment option for complications. A question is raised: what is the optimal way to achieve the best result in patients after primary failure? The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcomes of repeat MUS surgery in patients after excision of the sling with recurrent SUI. We compared its effectiveness with uncomplicated cases treated with TVT. 27 patients who underwent the repeated MUS and 50 consecutive patients after primary TVT were enrolled in the study. After 6 months, we have found that 24 (88.46%) patients from repeat sling group and 48 (96%) patients after primary sling were dry (1-hour pad test, 2 g or less). The difference between groups was not significant. We showed statistically significant improvement of quality of life in both groups. In conclusion, we showed that repeated sling after MUS excision is almost as effective as primary MUS. We postulate that sling excision and repeated MUS may be the best option for persistent SUI and/or complications after MUS procedures. Further multicenter observations are ongoing as to provide results on bigger group of cases.</td><td>['Aftercare', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Prosthesis Failure', 'Quality of Life', 'Suburethral Slings', 'Urinary Incontinence, Stress']</td><td>['25973423', '17706716', '26825409', '26811112', '26130017', '26134541', '22875405', '22976532', '18639207', '26528340', '23818418', '19913831', '25568465', '22527541', '21793084']</td></tr><tr><td>27999778</td><td>Environmental Characteristics of Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers in Marine System, with Emphasis on Marine Organisms and Sediments.</td><td>['Zhang', 'Wang', 'Song', 'Ren', 'Yuan', 'Yan', 'Zhang', 'Pei', 'He']</td><td>2016</td><td>BioMed research international</td><td>Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), due to their widespread usage as flame retardants and their lipophilicity and persistence, have become ubiquitous in the environment. It is urgent to understand the environmental characteristics of PBDEs in marine system, but they have attracted little attention. We summarize the available data and analyze the regional distributions, controlling factors, and congener patterns of PBDEs in marine and associated environmental matrixes worldwide. Based on meta-analysis, after separating the estuarial sites from the marine sites, ignoring the extraordinary sample sites such as those located just near the point source, the PBDE concentration levels are still in the same order of magnitude from global scale. Despite Principal Component Analysis, the congener patterns of sediments are predominant with the heavy brominated congeners (BDE-209 contributing over 75% to the total load) while the biota abound with the light ones (BDE-47, BDE-99, and BDE-100 taking about 80%). The ratio between BDE-99 and BDE-100 for the lower trophic-level species often turns to be greater than 1, while for those higher species the ratio may be below 1, and some species feed mainly on the crustaceans and zooplankton seems to have a higher ratio value. The data of the PBDEs in marine system are currently limited; thus, data gaps are identified as well.</td><td>['Animals', 'Aquatic Organisms', 'Crustacea', 'Ecosystem', 'Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers', 'Zooplankton']</td><td>['26453821', '25247482', '17906974', '22833350', '22913607', '23602656', '11347917', '22922393', '21465540', '19095284', '16989889', '22766500', '15862403', '15952354', '24781305', '18174948', '21208636', '23872388', '16581167', '25460763', '15950246', '25038592', '24984918', '23822835', '27066981', '25463257', '25455378', '25569575', '20096439', '16580050', '25463258', '22792864', '15051373', '25548035', '25079089', '19272684', '14740725', '21423921', '17632184', '16294860', '14998004', '16019054', '16757014', '23478126', '14572084', '20875665', '23870498', '20299075', '25686867', '12875385', '12380070', '20129628', '26412400', '25454222', '25042535', '12850086', '22595764', '19100622', '24699838', '21802148', '25369178', '11695126', '16572774', '17716730', '17937274', '16814845', '24997943', '24140702', '15694478', '16764911', '18200849', '26725304', '23837541', '20473428', '19544876', '17120549', '25585150', '15046327', '16024080', '15536506', '24012900', '19431944', '17291651', '11999791', '21550625', '17703857', '25241209', '17447545', '12850099', '24486972', '21269652', '15325146', '11999784']</td></tr><tr><td>27999779</td><td>Marginal Bone Level Evaluation after Functional Loading Around Two Different Dental Implant Designs.</td><td>['Ho', 'Salamanca', 'Lin', 'Lee', 'Chang']</td><td>2016</td><td>BioMed research international</td><td>Conclusion.

This study uses the self-assembly approach to produce a fibroblast-derived decellularized vascular scaffold (FDVS) that can be available off-the-shelf. Briefly, extracellular matrix scaffolds were produced using human dermal fibroblasts sheets rolled around a mandrel, maintained in culture to allow for the formation of cohesive and three-dimensional tubular constructs, and decellularized by immersion in deionized water. The FDVSs were implanted as an aortic interpositional graft in six Sprague-Dawley rats for 6 months. Five out of the six implants were still patent 6 months after the surgery. Histological analysis showed the infiltration of cells on both abluminal and luminal sides, and immunofluorescence analysis suggested the formation of neomedia comprised of smooth muscle cells and lined underneath with an endothelium. Furthermore, to verify the feasibility of producing tissue-engineered blood vessels of clinically relevant length and diameter, scaffolds with a 4.6 mm inner diameter and 17 cm in length were fabricated with success and stored for an extended period of time, while maintaining suitable properties following the storage period. This novel demonstration of the potential of the FDVS could accelerate the clinical availability of tissue-engineered blood vessels and warrants further preclinical studies.</td><td>['Animals', 'Bioprosthesis', 'Blood Vessel Prosthesis', 'Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation', 'Fibroblasts', 'Humans', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Scaffolds', 'Vascular Remodeling']</td><td>['3897723', '17457945', '24745941', '17000406', '2934816', '22729285', '8846174', '22064599', '16397155', '6222499', '20934214', '21360466', '23031531', '22626247', '16491087', '21457095', '16823109', '21288158', '24352519', '17914054', '20464717', '21289273', '21417722', '21873986', '11802134', '23683757', '19207043', '22056286', '25530850', '17600663', '21319339', '6265920', '25749291', '10205057', '9692567', '9438410', '2940983', '19819544', '17438517', '4075377', '24631624', '24417686', '17597354', '24103406', '21571635', '21421015']</td></tr><tr><td>27999786</td><td>A Sparsity-Constrained Preconditioned Kaczmarz Reconstruction Method for Fluorescence Molecular Tomography.</td><td>['Chen', 'Liang', 'Li', 'Qiu']</td><td>2016</td><td>BioMed research international</td><td>Fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) is an imaging technique that can localize and quantify fluorescent markers to resolve biological processes at molecular and cellular levels. Owing to a limited number of measurements and a large number of unknowns as well as the diffusive transport of photons in biological tissues, the inverse problem in FMT is usually highly ill-posed. In this work, a sparsity-constrained preconditioned Kaczmarz (SCP-Kaczmarz) method is proposed to reconstruct the fluorescent target for FMT. The SCP-Kaczmarz method uses the preconditioning strategy to minimize the correlation between the rows of the forward matrix and constrains the Kaczmarz iteration results to be sparse. Numerical simulation and phantom and in vivo experiments were performed to test the efficiency of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that both the convergence and accuracy of the proposed method are improved compared with the classical memory-efficient low-cost Kaczmarz method.</td><td>['Animals', 'Humans', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Optical Imaging']</td><td>['17228106', '21672672', '24815621', '22561987', '17356610', '9101332', '24575335', '22390906', '20570760', '18218454', '23722452', '15560007', '20129842', '22410902', '19259141', '19340104', '16834550', '23843087', '8587533', '19551128', '25121547', '21753235', '17356660', '20059248', '19566290', '17445504', '24334634', '18601421', '20676081', '11814231']</td></tr><tr><td>27999787</td><td>Random Subspace Aggregation for Cancer Prediction with Gene Expression Profiles.</td><td>['Yang', 'Liu', 'Yuan', 'Wei', 'Zhang']</td><td>2016</td><td>BioMed research international</td><td>Conclusions.

However, the efficacy of EF24 against cancer metastasis, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), remains elusive. In this study, the effect of EF24 on HCCLM-3 and HepG2 cell migration and invasion was detected by wound healing and transwell assay, respectively. The results revealed that EF24 suppressed the migration and invasion of both HCCLM-3 and HepG2 cells. Furthermore, EF24 treatment decreased the formation of filopodia on the cell surface and inhibited the phosphorylation of Src in both cell lines, which may help contribute towards understanding the mechanism underlying the suppressive effect of EF24 on HCC migration and invasion. Additionally, the expression of total- and phosphorylated-Src in primary HCC tissues and their paired lymph node metastatic tissues was detected, and phosphorylated-Src was found to be associated with HCC lymph node metastasis. The results of this study suggest that Src is a novel and promising therapeutic target in HCC and provide evidence to support the hypothesis that EF24 may be a useful therapeutic agent for the treatment of HCC.</td><td>['Benzylidene Compounds', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cell Movement', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperidones', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)']</td><td>['24484937', '24760417', '22492983', '21448419', '12618900', '19647363', '12020799', '21901145', '15210154', '14737122', '15711178', '16051170', '25725129', '21836020', '18765415', '11819809', '17999464', '20815812', '22492726', '24159579', '17684018', '22108826', '9581679', '17174384', '18682687', '20615389', '25256401', '24134840', '26722284', '18577686', '21575146', '24371229', '19401701', '8423624', '21777950', '20616959', '11717970']</td></tr><tr><td>27999808</td><td>E. coli-Based Cell-Free System.</td><td>['Zhang', 'Zhang', 'Wang', 'Zi', 'Wang', 'Chen', 'Wan']</td><td>2016</td><td>BioMed research international</td><td>E. coli cell-free system provides us a promising and convenient platform to enhance expression of the target proteins economically.</td><td>['Arabidopsis', 'Arabidopsis Proteins', 'Cell-Free System', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gene Expression', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Recombinant Proteins']</td><td>['16766677', '17103012', '20375108', '15466234', '19309312', '22160701', '15830344', '19924127', '16365038', '26274523', '22275217', '12376648', '18326790', '26350765', '15292193', '22968126', '20885983', '22008973', '12805596', '19558718', '12468729', '16797767', '16487613', '19087952']</td></tr><tr><td>27999809</td><td>Detection of the Single-Session Complete Ablation Rate by Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound during Ultrasound-Guided Laser Ablation for Benign Thyroid Nodules: A Prospective Study.</td><td>['Ma', 'Zhou', 'Wu', 'Tian', 'Zhao']</td><td>2016</td><td>BioMed research international</td><td>P > 0.05).

In this paper, we analyzed the failure of the provision of dialysis services observed in recent disasters and discussed how to prepare for disasters to continue dialysis therapy. Japan has frequently experienced devastating earthquakes. A lot of dialysis centers could not continue dialysis treatment owing to damage caused by these earthquakes. The survey by Japanese Society for Dialysis Treatment (JSDT) after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 showed that failure of lifelines such as electric power and water supply was the leading cause of the malfunction of dialysis treatment. Our hospital is located in Shizuoka Prefecture, where one of the biggest earthquakes is predicted to occur in the near future. In addition to reconstructing earthquake-resistant buildings and facilities, we therefore have adopted double electric and water lifelines by introducing emergency generators and well water supply systems. It is very important to inform politicians, bureaucrats, and local water departments that dialysis treatment, a life sustaining therapy for patients with end stage renal diseases, requires a large amount of water. We cannot prevent an earthquake but can curb the extent of a disaster by preparing for earthquakes.</td><td>['Disaster Medicine', 'Disaster Planning', 'Earthquakes', 'Humans', 'Renal Dialysis', 'Water Supply', 'Water Wells']</td><td>['8941568', '22578674', '26306054', '9095115', '26768810', '9314303', '17699499', '27281197', '18271158', '17699500', '25665093', '26034592', '21852660', '11168962', '26032113', '19212421']</td></tr><tr><td>27999811</td><td>Per2 Expression in Rats with Spinal Cord Injury.</td><td>['Cheng', 'Wang', 'Guo', 'Yang', 'Zhang', 'Xie', 'Zhu', 'Lu', 'Zhu']</td><td>2016</td><td>BioMed research international</td><td>Per2 expression shortly after EA treatment.</td><td>['Animals', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Colon', 'Electroacupuncture', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Motility', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Male', 'Period Circadian Proteins', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Spinal Cord Injuries']</td><td>['17919497', '18503802', '22457863', '11175370', '24617798', '15951747', '12675971', '25349387', '21984981', '17768682', '22417783', '24621049', '20558764', '12164245', '17675004', '26064396', '25417608', '8963975', '12882317', '16968601', '548245', '11420734', '20091094', '3609660', '10930389', '7783230', '22483041', '19197567', '15503696', '25010841', '10543012', '21063714', '16799881']</td></tr><tr><td>27999812</td><td>Glucose >200 mg/dL during Continuous Glucose Monitoring Identifies Adult Patients at Risk for Development of Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes.</td><td>['Taylor-Cousar', 'Janssen', 'Wilson', 'Clair', 'Pickard', 'Jones', 'Brayshaw', 'Chacon', 'Barboa', 'Sontag', 'Accurso', 'Nichols', 'Saavedra', 'Nick']</td><td>2016</td><td>Journal of diabetes research</td><td>p = 0.0002).</td><td>['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring', 'Comorbidity', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Diabetes Complications', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Female', 'Glucose Intolerance', 'Glucose Tolerance Test', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']</td><td>['20215454', '19207231', '24357215', '18818782', '2492695', '17960051', '21228248', '19279304', '15983304', '15699230', '23809507', '19162566', '11549516', '16682829', '19918014', '12390923', '7981562', '26087115', '20071479', '16123480', '19910502', '25171312', '11529531', '23205765', '21115772', '12766139', '17322485', '6365738', '25479583', '24359972', '19592632', '18922724', '7549632', '23952705', '19542209']</td></tr><tr><td>27999813</td><td>The Pathophysiological Impact of HLA Class Ia and HLA-G Expression and Regulatory T Cells in Malignant Melanoma: A Review.</td><td>['Johansen', 'Lock-Andersen', 'Hviid']</td><td>2016</td><td>Journal of immunology research</td><td>Malignant melanoma, a very common type of cancer, is a rapidly growing cancer of the skin with an increase in incidence among the Caucasian population. The disease is seen through all age groups and is very common in the younger age groups. Several studies have examined the risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms of malignant melanoma, which have enlightened our understanding of the development of the disease, but we have still to fully understand the complex immunological interactions. The examination of the interaction between the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) system and prognostic outcome has shown interesting results, and a correlation between the down- or upregulation of these antigens and prognosis has been seen through many different types of cancer. In malignant melanoma, HLA class Ia has been seen to influence the effects of pharmaceutical drug treatment as well as the overall prognosis, and the HLA class Ib and regulatory T cells have been correlated with tumor progression. Although there is still no standardized immunological treatment worldwide, the interaction between the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) system and tumor progression seems to be a promising focus in the way of optimizing the treatment of malignant melanoma.</td><td>['Animals', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HLA-A1 Antigen', 'HLA-G Antigens', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Melanoma', 'Pregnancy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory', 'Ultraviolet Rays']</td><td>['20957629', '21726203', '17241907', '8759605', '9100981', '25858803', '18083379', '17981115', '12407407', '11208853', '11677100', '11466692', '23485231', '21482709', '18279546', '16043361', '24482746', '9894850', '9190116', '12200046', '12068308', '14602236', '21792710', '8664138', '20547193', '15103024', '10092547', '21128238', '18334671', '1512795', '22095460', '18545995', '15780179', '22465194', '21086121', '12202672', '10843728', '21256809', '10597249', '18381941', '21436444', '14639610', '24196788', '14708716', '26441390', '21874003', '24997850', '8025464', '26819277', '77067', '20843377', '24142142', '22475760', '27471649', '19584149', '20525992', '23482353', '19710684', '16809620', '25399552', '10958353', '24860568', '21639810', '2038058', '17982631', '25072125', '15035987', '16905682', '19186150', '15069585', '18366057', '21210353', '21107637', '23372575', '19095149', '19756593', '21057081', '19062042', '9637706', '20500773', '19917835', '23890154', '21466615', '18706274', '21972088', '15661905', '16125927', '25603775', '15617990', '11905603', '15617989', '16125929', '16280356', '10963203', '10631934', '16297704', '26822383', '26858331', '18688170', '21964766', '23897901', '18281266', '22532371', '11948496', '11926409', '15670976', '9539768', '10809759', '14746862']</td></tr><tr><td>27999815</td><td>Is there a relationship between non-obstructive coronary artery disease or cardiac syndrome X and migraine?

Recently, we noticed that the frequency of migraine in patients with CSX was noticeably higher than in healthy people and in CAD patients.

Currently, coronary artery angiography is the gold standard for diagnosis of asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). Computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) can visually demonstrate the morphology, trend and extent of coronary stenosis and is commonly used in clinical screening of CAD. Myocardial perfusion imaging can be used not only to identify whether anatomical stenosis causes myocardial dysfunction, but to also assess the risk stratification and prognosis of myocardial disease (MD). Myocardial perfusion imaging using morphing combined with CTCA can simultaneously show the relationship between CAD and myocardial ischemia from an anatomical and functional aspect. This allows earlier diagnosis of asymptomatic CAD myocardial ischemia, accurate identification of the culprit vessels, and could prevent unnecessary interventional therapy. The 1-day dobutamine stress/resting met-hod is also one of the methods used. The combination of CTCA and the morphing technique can provide anatomical and functional information on coronary arteries at the same time, significantly improving the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MD.</td><td>['Artifacts', 'Asymptomatic Diseases', 'Cardiac-Gated Imaging Techniques', 'Computed Tomography Angiography', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Humans', 'Motion', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Radiographic Image Enhancement', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>27999817</td><td>Cauda equina syndrome.

As this seems to be the first perfusion SPET study in this indication, the obtained data may be discussed carefully. There are mainly the following questions: a) Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF): There is no description on how the rCBF was calculated: Was it scaled relatively to the whole brain mean value or to the cerebellar mean value? b) P value threshold and clusters: There is no indication of whether the authors are performing any kind of correction for multiple comparisons in the statistical parametric mapping (SPM) t-test. This, combined with the use of a really \"\"liberal\"\" voxel P value of only 0.01 could be subject to providing many false positive results. Generally a P value threshold of 0.001 should be used. In addition, there is no information related to the clusters. For the question of the validity of parametric statistical methods used for the analysis of functional neuroimaging data, we would like to mention the important recent paper by Eklund et al. 2016. c) Data analysis: The authors state (p. 97): \"\"As some abnormal rCBF in adenosine-stressed state might relate with normal responses to adenosine compared to resting state, we excluded those regions that showed abnormal rCBF in stressed state in healthy controls (Table 4) from those in IA group (Table 5). The rest abnormal regions were compared between the IA group and the control group\"\". For this, with SPM a flexible factorial design with all the data rather than only t-tests would have been interesting to find out whether the difference between the groups at stress is the same difference observed between the groups at rest. In \"\"traditional\"\" region-of-interest statistics, a repeated 2-way ANOVA to account for individual variance would have been done. The authors are, however, just \"\"manually\"\" removing the regions that pop-up in the previous analysis. In conclusion, it would be of great scientific interest if the authors of this first SPET study on an important indication, IA, could give us some more details on their data.\"</td><td>['Behavior, Addictive', 'Brain', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Humans', 'Internet', 'Regional Blood Flow', 'Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon']</td><td>['27331201']</td></tr><tr><td>27999820</td><td>Regional cerebral blood flow changes in patients with internet addiction: Authors' reply.</td><td>['Liu', 'Shi']</td><td>null</td><td>Hellenic journal of nuclear medicine</td><td>\"To the comments of Prof. Andreas Otte to our work we reply as follows: As was mentioned by Prof. Andreas Otte, our study was the first study of regional cerebral blood flow changes in patients with internet addiction. Therefore, there was not much previous, established experience to refer to. As an exploration study, it was inevitable that there were some insufficiencies. We feel great appreciation to Prof. Andreas Otte for his comments on our work, which will improve our studying quality in this field in the future. Prof. Andreas Otte inquired in his letter how the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was calculated, and was scaled, relatively to the whole brain mean value or to the cerebellar mean value. All rCBF data were scaled relatively to the whole brain, in our study. As for the question in relation to the test level, the P-value of 0.05 was only used when comparing intergroup differences of baseline or clinical information of patients using SPSS, while the P-value of 0.01 was used for the statistical parametric mapping (SPM) t-test. We had tried using the test level of P<0.001 to indicate the significance when performing the SPM t-test, but there were not very meaningful findings identified at this test level. This might be explained by the relatively old generation and low sensitivity of the SPET scanner used in our study. For the purpose to identify more potential cerebral regions with abnormal rCBF, we lowered down the test level to 0.01, although this might had resulted in some false-positive results. However, in order to control false-positive errors, we performed intragroup comparisons from rest to adenosine-stressed status firstly by paired t test to identify cerebral regions with obvious rCBF changes because of administration of adenosine. On the basis of these cerebral regions, we subsequently performed a two-sample t test to compare intergroup differences to identify cerebral regions with rCBF that could have attributed to internet addiction. We believed that this \"\"twostep\"\" statistical mode might reduce the probability of falsepositive results to some extent. As for the cluster question in relation to SPM analysis, it seems more problematic and more prone for clusterwise inference to produce false-positive results than voxelwise inference, as mentioned in the paper by Eklund et al (2016). We did not take the two-way ANOVA analysis, instead, we performed the more suitable \"\"twostep\"\" statistical mode mentioned above. However, when facing multiple comparisons, we did adjust the P values with the relatively conservative Bonferroni method.

The main objective of this study was to determine the effect of a 16-week high-protein caloric restriction combined with resistance training on chronic disease risk factors in obese older individuals with metabolic impairments. A total of 26 overweight adults aged between 60 and 75 years (BMI 32.4 ± 3.9 kg/m2) with at least 2 factors of the metabolic syndrome participated in this study and were randomized into two groups: 1) high-protein caloric restriction (HP; n= 12) and 2) high-protein caloric restriction combined with dynamic-resistance training (HP+RT; n=14). Caloric intake was reduced by 500 kcal/d in all participants and protein intake equated 25-30% of total calories (~1.4 g/kg/d). Exercise training consisted of 3 session/week of resistance training on pulley machines. Outcome measures included total and trunk fat mass (FM), total and appendicular lean body mass (LBM), fasting glucose level, lipid profile and blood pressure. Our results showed that total and trunk FM (all p<0.0001) as well as fasting glucose (p<0.0001), triglycerides (p=0.002) and total cholesterol (p=0.03) levels decreased similarly in both groups. However, total (p=0.04) and appendicular (p=0.02) LBM decreased in the HP group only. Our data show that high-protein energy restriction improves health profile of obese elderly at high risk of chronic disease but needs to be combined with resistance training to maintain LBM.</td><td>['Aged', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Body Mass Index', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Cholesterol', 'Dietary Proteins', 'Energy Intake', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male',

The paper presents the methodology and current status of the Task Force on EIP on AHA synergies. Synergies are in line with the Action Groups' new Renovated Action Plan (2016-2018) to ensure that their future objectives are coherent and fully connected. The outcomes and impact of synergies are using the Monitoring and Assessment Framework for the EIP on AHA (MAFEIP). Eight proposals for synergies have been approved by the Task Force: Five cross-cutting synergies which can be used for all current and future synergies as they consider overarching domains (appropriate polypharmacy, citizen empowerment, teaching and coaching on AHA, deployment of synergies to EU regions, Responsible Research and Innovation), and three cross-cutting synergies focussing on current Action Group activities (falls, frailty, integrated care and chronic respiratory diseases).</td><td>['Accidental Falls', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cooperative Behavior', 'Europe', 'European Continental Ancestry Group', 'Frail Elderly', 'Health Behavior', 'Humans', 'Multiple Chronic Conditions', 'Organizational Innovation', 'Polypharmacy', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']</td><td>['26346580', '22278387', '23405917', '25962954', '26184344', '22540290', '21070299', '26498697', '1464716', '25238874', '26482699', '25616486', '11447509', '26275595', '24286918', '26391559', '26534066', '24925919', '20085954', '26571642', '26433212', '26476756', '26635600', '18309758', '25694821', '22134410', '10868853', '26688860', '25705895', '26148220', '22464390', '26704254', '18331513', '23060309', '16926208', '26929314', '11823329', '23855711', '3712144', '25866212', '25288587']</td></tr><tr><td>27999846</td><td>Predictors of Health-Related Quality of Life Decline after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Older Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis.</td><td>['Boureau', 'Trochu', 'Rouaud', 'Hureau', 'Jaafar', 'Manigold', 'Letocart', 'Guerin', 'Berrut', 'de Decker']</td><td>2017</td><td>The journal of nutrition, health & aging</td><td>Transcatheter aortic-valve implantation (TAVI) has been shown to improve survival and quality of life in patients with severe aortic stenosis.

Different from other algorithms performed in time domain, SGL1PSD introduces a time-resolved strategy into fluorescence yield reconstruction. The algorithm consists of four steps. Step 1 reconstructs the initial yield map with full time gate strategy; steps 2–4 reconstruct the inverse lifetime map, the yield map, and the inverse lifetime map again with time-resolved strategy, respectively. The reconstruction result of each step is used as a priori for the reconstruction of the next step. Projected iterated Tikhonov regularization algorithm is adopted for the yield map reconstructions in steps 1 and 3 to provide a solution with iterative refinement and nonnegative constraint. The inverse lifetime map reconstructions in steps 2 and 4 are based on L 1 regularization projected steepest descent algorithm, which employ the L 1 regularization to reduce the ill-posedness of the high-dimensional nonlinear problem.

The reduction in fluorescence intensity near the embedded objects was found to depend on the geometry and the refractive index difference between the object and the surrounding solution. The observed fluorescence intensity gradients do not reflect the fluorophore concentration in the solution. It is suggested to apply a Gaussian fit or smoothing to the observed fluorescence intensity gradient and use this as a basis to recover the fluorophore concentration in the proximity of the refractive index step change. The method requires that the reference and sample objects have the same geometry and refractive index.

Due to rapid advancements in computing power, camera/detector technologies, and tissue clearing techniques, light sheet methods are becoming increasingly popular for biomedical imaging applications at the cellular and tissue levels. Light sheet imaging modalities couple rapid imaging rates, low-levels of phototoxicity, and excellent signal to noise ratios, contributing to their popularity for experimental biology. However, the current major limitation of light sheet microscopy arises from optical aberrations, with the main drawback being the defocusing introduced by refractive index variations that accompany clearing techniques. Here, we propose an inexpensive and easy to build light sheet based instrumentation to overcome this limitation by optomechanically decoupling the sample scanning movement from the detection step. Our solution is relatively simple to implement and also provides increased modularity by using a swappable excitation arm. This expands the range of samples we can image on a single system, from high resolution for single cells at ? m spatial resolution, to tissues with mm spatial resolution.

Multivariate analysis demonstrated an independently increased risk of mortality, minor and major complications, pneumonia, sepsis, and length of stay in SCI patients.

Heavy-metal plant concentrations were determined in both washed and unwashed plant leaves to determine whether foliar deposition played any role in plant metal uptake. Soil concentrations of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn were all lower than the Korean standard soil limits and showed no significant influence from road traffic. In contrast, both Ni and Cr concentrations in soils collected within 10 m of the road were 4 and 5 times greater, respectively, than those in soils collected 70 m from the road. Heavy-metal concentrations in unwashed Chinese cabbage leaf collected at 5 m from the road were consistently greater than those of washed leaf samples, thus indicating the deposition of traffic-related particles on the plant surface. With the exception of Cu, all heavy-metal concentration in washed plant samples collected at 5 m also showed greater accumulation compared with samples collected further away. This was mainly attributed to increased total soil heavy-metal concentrations and increased metal phytoavailability induced by decreases in soil pH near the road. However, overall heavy-metal soil concentrations were well lower than the allowable concentrations, and the levels observed in plants collected in this study were considered not to currently pose a significant risk to human health. However, some traffic-related heavy metals, in particular Cr and Ni, were being accumulated in the roadside UA environment, which may warrant some caution regarding the environment and/or health issues in the future.</td><td>['Crops, Agricultural', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Metals, Heavy', 'Particulate Matter', 'Republic of Korea', 'Soil Pollutants', 'Vehicle Emissions']</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>27999868</td><td>In vivo imaging of systemic transport and elimination of xenobiotics and endogenous molecules in mice.</td><td>['Reif', 'Ghallab', 'Beattie', 'Günther', 'Kuepfer', 'Kaye', 'Hengstler']</td><td>2017</td><td>Archives of toxicology</td><td>We describe a two-photon microscopy-based method to evaluate the in vivo systemic transport of compounds.

Moreover, tools to image immune cells, which can influence transport processes in inflamed tissues, are described. This powerful approach provides new possibilities for the analysis of compound transport in multiple organs and can support physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling, in order to obtain more precise predictions at the whole body scale.</td><td>['Acetaminophen', 'Animals', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Hepatocytes', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kupffer Cells', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microscopy', 'Video Recording', 'Xenobiotics']</td><td>['16299478', '2321027', '25393841', '23720336', '12162761', '11257140', '26054544', '19898521', '12527751', '26188075', '11733045', '20484673', '22118457', '25569332', '24824608', '26610202', '26045267', '10959812', '17868096', '26022689', '26436648', '26639393', '21993815', '18242495', '20388726', '20835990', '18647170', '23708969', '23100531', '24034621', '26858722', '10621974', '24890723', '12459835', '21030952', '19280352', '14595365', '23628966', '26529256', '18173647', '26459520', '24625393', '22997258']</td></tr><tr><td>27999869</td><td>[Perioperative patient management in orthogeriatrics].</td><td>['Moldzio', 'Peters']</td><td>2017</td><td>Der Orthopade</td><td>The management of major orthopedic surgery in the elderly prototypically reflects the perioperative risks of geriatric, often very frail patients reflecting an aging population.

As such, MD-CTE is increasingly utilized in the workup of occult gastrointestinal bleeding. In this article, we review the spectrum of focal small bowel masses with pathologic correlation. Adenocarcinoma, the most common primary small bowel malignancy, presents as a focal irregular mass occasionally with circumferential extension leading to obstruction. Small bowel carcinoid tumors most commonly arise in the ileum and are characterized by avid enhancement and marked desmoplastic response of metastatic lesions. Aneurysmal dilatation of small bowel is pathognomonic for lymphoma and secondary findings of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly should be sought. Benign small bowel masses such as leiomyoma and adenoma may be responsible for occult gastrointestinal bleeding. However, primary vascular lesions of the small bowel remain the most common cause for occult small bowel gastrointestinal bleeding. The arterial phase of contrast obtained with CTE aids in recognition of the vascular nature of these lesions. Systemic conditions such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and Crohn's disease may be suggested by the presence of multiple small bowel lesions. Lastly, potential pitfalls such as ingested material should be considered when faced with focal small bowel masses.</td><td>['Humans', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Neoplasms', 'Intestine, Small', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>27999876</td><td>Correlation between CT perfusion parameters and Fuhrman grade in pTlb renal cell carcinoma.</td><td>['Chen', 'Kang', 'Wei', 'Xu', 'Ye', 'Wang', 'Lu', 'Lu']</td><td>2017</td><td>Abdominal radiology (New York)</td><td>To evaluate the correlation of CT perfusion parameters with the Fuhrman grade in pT1b (4-7 cm) renal cell carcinoma (RCC).</td><td>['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Tumor Burden']</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>27999877</td><td>Imaging patterns and focal lesions in fatty liver: a pictorial review.</td><td>['Venkatesh', 'Hennedige', 'Johnson', 'Hough', 'Fletcher']</td><td>2017</td><td>Abdominal radiology (New York)</td><td>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common cause of chronic liver disease and affects nearly one-third of US population. With the increasing trend of obesity in the population, associated fatty change in the liver will be a common feature observed in imaging studies. Fatty liver causes changes in liver parenchyma appearance on imaging modalities including ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and may affect the imaging characteristics of focal liver lesions (FLLs). The imaging characteristics of FLLs were classically described in a non-fatty liver. In addition, focal fatty change and focal fat sparing may also simulate FLLs. Knowledge of characteristic patterns of fatty change in the liver (diffuse, geographical, focal, subcapsular, and perivascular) and their impact on the detection and characterization of FLL is therefore important. In general, fatty change may improve detection of FLLs on MRI using fat suppression sequences, but may reduce sensitivity on a single-phase (portal venous) CT and conventional ultrasound. In patients with fatty liver, MRI is generally superior to ultrasound and CT for detection and characterization of FLL. In this pictorial essay, we describe the imaging patterns of fatty change in the liver and its effect on detection and characterization of FLLs on ultrasound, CT, MRI, and PET.</td><td>['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Fatty Liver', 'Humans']</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>27999878</td><td>Imaging of autoimmune hepatitis and overlap syndromes.</td><td>['Malik', 'Venkatesh']</td><td>2017</td><td>Abdominal radiology (New York)</td><td>Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an uncommon, chronic inflammatory, and relapsing liver disease of unknown origin that may lead to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation, or death.

It is described as the inability to relax muscles during muscle tone assessment with the subject involuntary facilitating or opposing the examiner. Although related to cognitive impairment and frontal lobe function, the underlying mechanisms have not been clarified. Moreover, criteria to distinguish oppositional paratonia from parkinsonian rigidity or spasticity are not yet available. Paratonia is very frequently encountered in clinical practice and only semi-quantitative rating scales are available. The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of a quantitative measure of paratonia using surface electromyography. Paratonia was elicited by performing consecutive metronome-synchronized continuous and discontinuous elbow movements in a group of paratonic patients with cognitive impairment. Goniometric and electromyographic recordings were performed on biceps and triceps brachii muscles. Facilitatory (mitgehen) and oppositional (gegenhalten) paratonia could be recorded on both muscles. After normalization with voluntary maximal contraction, biceps showed higher paratonia than triceps. Facilitatory paratonia was higher than oppositional on the biceps. Movement repetition induced increased paratonic burst amplitude only when flexion and extension movements were performed continuously. Both facilitatory and oppositional paratonia increased with movement repetition. Only oppositional paratonia increased following faster movements. This is the first study providing a quantitative and objective characterization of paratonia using electromyography. Unlike parkinsonian rigidity, oppositional paratonia increases with velocity and with consecutive movement repetition. Like spasticity, oppositional paratonia is velocity-dependent, but different from spasticity, it increases during movement repetition instead of decreasing. A quantitative measure of paratonia could help better understanding its pathophysiology and could be used for research purposes on cognitive impairment.</td><td>['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Electromyography', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Movement', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Neuropsychological Tests']</td><td>['23335966', '21269542', '15395792', '10634238', '25536218', '17384318', '16172703', '9143081', '12473008', '1393509', '25530960', '9781514']</td></tr><tr><td>27999883</td><td>Lifespan development of the bilateral deficit in a simple reaction time task.</td><td>['Vieluf', 'Aschersleben', 'Panzer']</td><td>2017</td><td>Experimental brain research</td><td>Performing an action at a maximum speed or with a maximum strength simultaneously with two limbs leads to a lower performance than the sum of unimanual performances.

Inverse developmental changes of childrens' and older adults' brain structures connecting both hemispheres, i.e., the corpus callosum, might importantly contribute to this phenomenon. The seemingly similar developments have been observed with different experimental protocols in the different age groups, respectively. To test for similarities and differences in changes of the bilateral deficit at critical periods of the lifespan development of bimanual actions, children, young adults, and older adults performed a simple reaction time task uni- and bimanually. Reaction times and the resulting bilateral deficit, as well as reaction time variability were analyzed. As expected, reaction times were different for the young adults between the uni- and the bimanual task. Children and older adults performed both conditions with similar reaction times. However, a difference in the direction of the %bilateral deficit occurred between the two age groups.

However, there seems to be a heterogeneous cortical (re)modeling response to loading at different regions within the same bone, which may lead to inconsistent findings since most studies analyze only one region. It remains unclear if the local mechanical environment is responsible for this heterogeneous response and whether both formation and resorption are affected. Thus, we compared the formation and resorptive response to in vivo loading and the strain environment at two commonly analyzed regions in the mouse tibia, the mid-diaphysis and proximal metaphysis. We quantified cortical surface (re)modeling by tracking changes between geometrically aligned consecutive in vivo micro-tomography images (time lapse 15 days). We investigated the local mechanical strain environment using finite element analyses. The relationship between mechanical stimuli and surface (re)modeling was examined by sub-dividing the mid-diaphysis and proximal metaphysis into 32 sub-regions. In response to loading, metaphyseal cortical bone (re)modeled predominantly at the periosteal surface, whereas diaphyseal (re)modeling was more pronounced at the endocortical surface. Furthermore, different set points and slopes of the relationship between engendered strains and remodeling response were found for the endosteal and periosteal surfaces at the metaphyseal and diaphyseal regions. Resorption was correlated with strain at the endocortical, but not the periosteal surfaces, whereas, formation correlated with strain at all surfaces, except at the metaphyseal periosteal surface. Therefore, besides mechanical stimuli, other non-mechanical factors are likely driving regional differences in adaptation. Studies investigating adaptation to loading or other treatments should consider region-specific (re)modeling differences.</td><td>['Animals', 'Bone Remodeling', 'Cortical Bone', 'Diaphyses', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Mice', 'Stress, Mechanical', 'Tibia', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>27999885</td><td>Internal derangement in the temporomandibular joint of juveniles with clinical signs of TMD : MRI-assessed association with skeletal and dental classes.</td><td>['Stein', 'Hellak', 'Popović', 'Toll', 'Schauseil', 'Braun']</td><td>2017</td><td>Journal of orofacial orthopedics = Fortschritte der Kieferorthopadie : Organ/official journal Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Kieferorthopadie</td><td>The aim of this study was to investigate possible correlation of specific skeletal or dental class in children and adolescents with clinical signs of temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD) with the severity of internal derangement (ID) of the temporomandibular joint.</td><td>['Adolescent', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Malocclusion', 'Prevalence', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Symptom Assessment', 'Temporomandibular Joint', 'Temporomandibular Joint Disorders']</td><td>['8430181', '9540079', '16702453', '9927074', '11161157', '7861272', '22677023', '3473372', '16940483', '2399340', '1298767', '1731487', '21939814', '2086260', '16940482', '1545969', '3183247', '16088129', '17465655', '1603550', '2047089', '3481385', '23948363', '2923691', '19248341']</td></tr><tr><td>27999886</td><td>18F-FDG PET tumor textural features with gene expression in pharyngeal cancer and implications for radiotherapy-based treatment outcomes.</td><td>['Chen', 'Shen', 'Lin', 'Chen', 'Hsieh', 'Yen', 'Kao']</td><td>2017</td><td>European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging</td><td>18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) with gene-expression profiling in patients with pharyngeal cancer and determined the prognostic factors for radiotherapy-based treatment outcomes.</td><td>['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Fluorodeoxyglucose F18', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Pharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography', 'Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A']</td><td>['28083691', '25659884', '22739016', '25500829', '11857304', '15170446', '26311121', '23204495', '10811669', '23632962', '25971451', '24332450', '25339524', '16085592', '24008660', '22257792', '21321270', '21376230', '20949446', '22098794', '25051978', '24549286', '24217547', '26912429', '18474878', '23219566', '25514380', '20877357', '20530316', '16044346', '14652668', '23340594', '20537890']</td></tr><tr><td>27999887</td><td>Protecting DNA from errors and damage: an overview of DNA repair mechanisms in plants compared to mammals.</td><td>['Spampinato']</td><td>2017</td><td>Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS</td><td>The genome integrity of all organisms is constantly threatened by replication errors and DNA damage arising from endogenous and exogenous sources. Such base pair anomalies must be accurately repaired to prevent mutagenesis and/or lethality. Thus, it is not surprising that cells have evolved multiple and partially overlapping DNA repair pathways to correct specific types of DNA errors and lesions. Great progress in unraveling these repair mechanisms at the molecular level has been made by several talented researchers, among them Tomas Lindahl, Aziz Sancar, and Paul Modrich, all three Nobel laureates in Chemistry for 2015. Much of this knowledge comes from studies performed in bacteria, yeast, and mammals and has impacted research in plant systems. Two plant features should be mentioned. Plants differ from higher eukaryotes in that they lack a reserve germline and cannot avoid environmental stresses. Therefore, plants have evolved different strategies to sustain genome fidelity through generations and continuous exposure to genotoxic stresses. These strategies include the presence of unique or multiple paralogous genes with partially overlapping DNA repair activities. Yet, in spite (or because) of these differences, plants, especially Arabidopsis thaliana, can be used as a model organism for functional studies. Some advantages of this model system are worth mentioning: short life cycle, availability of both homozygous and heterozygous lines for many genes, plant transformation techniques, tissue culture methods and reporter systems for gene expression and function studies. Here, I provide a current understanding of DNA repair genes in plants, with a special focus on A. thaliana. It is expected that this review will be a valuable resource for future functional studies in the DNA repair field, both in plants and animals.</td><td>['Animals', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Light', 'Mammals', 'Plants']</td><td>['26525148', '24849603', '18682397', '23545420', '23521529', '18707020', '24751236', '19148648', '17182003', '25900572', '22122461', '24086042', '21867786', '25574025', '25681868', '25136112', '24934622', '19096507', '20227374', '18025084', '24716527', '19153659', '23316050', '25795113', '25569774', '19767619', '24157211', '23664777', '24767945', '19359474', '26034131', '20128879', '22055185', '23637284', '21070408', '22688271', '26653616', '20056608', '20971895', '16464023', '26616757', '26858742', '25448232', '23574700', '26436461', '17531815', '20499085', '21571596', '24155752', '20713735', '21325134', '24453986', '24102485', '24880780', '19682284', '22077663', '25862369', '20113510', '25870862', '24174542', '20646326', '24582502', '22860689', '25017100', '25488918', '22789755', '21307385', '23562323', '21670257', '21530420', '17672843', '21170715', '24667595', '21357745', '19443451', '24613763', '21030321', '20622147', '18000056', '24970148', '22214184', '26272552', '17088286', '24556841', '17996697', '19377479', '26352435', '23147676', '24363387', '21592868', '26151545', '24112784', '19288212', '24656613', '21655080', '24966870', '22362780', '21209706', '18007598', '20227927', '17965729', '26557130', '20154325', '19420220', '19457980', '26951435', '25037209', '22325353', '20706207', '21363960', '24638978', '16699813', '24696352', '25240767', '23868090', '25830375', '25956862', '19629035', '18551167', '23450167', '21704205', '26796427', '22467216', '26719141', '22841003', '25496918', '26439531', '21816818', '19515846', '19172180', '16624880', '20686871', '23535143', '24680878', '19228687', '23451779', '25465032', '26721386', '23565119', '22690124', '20086187', '17409070', '19558640', '19228922', '19690966', '23380521', '16623910', '26284109', '20571910', '22629260', '20383123', '26698650', '24278037', '16786303', '21870137', '22473985', '19372224', '26839580', '19202191', '23906714', '23994068', '26437586', '23184005', '25701376', '23161853', '22170053', '20657578', '23076011', '22303246', '24630899', '24829455', '16547115', '23545421', '24833228', '11130711', '21880593', '24678721', '22475811', '25881042', '22048164', '19339504', '23333306', '21786338', '22679557', '23625359', '23378590', '22179786', '21781197', '24856239', '23897892', '26725162', '19622396', '24788060', '18206974', '21821141', '25550082', '23408852', '24097900', '20833188', '23610439', '25950582', '23391514', '23050791', '20649466', '24335281', '22171004', '16786311']</td></tr><tr><td>27999888</td><td>Mechanisms of pluripotency maintenance in mouse embryonic stem cells.</td><td>['Chen', 'Cheng', 'Yen', 'Hsieh']</td><td>2017</td><td>Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS</td><td>Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), characterized by their pluripotency and capacity for self-renewal, are driven by a complex gene expression program composed of several regulatory mechanisms.

While patterning can involve signaling between neighbouring cells, in other contexts signals act over greater distances by traversing complex cellular landscapes to instruct the fate of distant cells. In this review, we explore different strategies adopted by cells to modulate signaling molecule range to allow correct patterning. We describe mechanisms for restricting signaling range and highlight how such short-range signaling can be exploited to not only control the fate of adjacent cells, but also to generate graded signaling within a field of cells. Other strategies include modulation of signaling molecule action by tissue architectural properties and the use of cellular membranous structures, such as signaling filopodia and exosomes, to actively deliver signaling ligands to target cells. Signaling filopodia can also be deployed to reach out and collect particular signals, thereby precisely controlling their site of action.</td><td>['Animals', 'Body Patterning', 'Cell Surface Extensions', 'Embryonic Development', 'Extracellular Vesicles', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Signal Transduction']</td><td>['17720697', '25556612', '20159596', '26632449', '11389830', '20182616', '20588296', '24284174', '22575959', '21690386', '19948496', '3383245', '24650915', '21390295', '25915120', '27032616', '16626681', '17117926', '22117545', '26974662', '9363949', '26008746', '9043068', '26550827', '22653731', '22437826', '2177439', '27101364', '16177792', '25617437', '25951303', '26490120', '27122169', '27199253', '17761850', '10619433', '18599504', '23744940', '24427298', '17108000', '12239569', '14561403', '26762480', '27591355', '11437451', '11551510', '17141155', '16204193', '6309857', '15703279', '8642258', '7588051', '6307529', '16785323', '4390734', '24385607', '24292069', '21244856', '21693509', '19000839', '24390349', '22157958', '27269283', '24121526', '19617627', '16198330', '23624372', '22285813', '8945511', '18430724', '25603171', '21113151', '17055473', '11463375', '22108505', '25471885', '16396909', '17609110', '21995331', '18505598', '22895187', '23995685', '9363950', '2699855', '9630221', '25642644', '12478285', '23048185', '19793889', '15240568', '15296719', '22733779', '2129012', '5411117', '9334287', '21546910', '12372258', '18255029', '25337877', '10367889', '18775317', '24560610', '27364476', '12194851', '19741606', '27364467', '15875013', '22677548', '16368928', '22609552', '22902404', '16678095', '25653388', '25360738', '26131929', '15110707', '11030649', '2688897', '4663624', '18583612', '25472772', '25865482', '19228882', '26550824', '19837038', '10744972', '16678096', '26863187', '15889083', '12372301', '8287482', '23035643', '8689684', '2598265', '23276604', '25804733', '3383244', '12586063', '27050948', '20664066', '26456819', '27396324', '22983114', '23353890', '22203956', '19077532', '21801015', '20453847', '18701888', '24466061', '26701906', '22509132', '26506307', '17397399']</td></tr><tr><td>27999890</td><td>Effect of end-inspiratory plateau pressure duration on driving pressure.</td><td>['Mezidi', 'Yonis', 'Aublanc', 'Lissonde', 'Louf-Durier', 'Perinel', 'Tapponnier', 'Richard', 'Guérin']</td><td>2017</td><td>Intensive care medicine</td><td>null</td><td>['Humans', 'Lung Volume Measurements', 'Maximal Respiratory Pressures', 'Positive-Pressure Respiration', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tidal Volume']</td><td>['25693014', '12528034', '27318943', '10793162', '27894328', '28573391']</td></tr><tr><td>27999892</td><td>Tunable recombinant protein expression in E. coli: promoter systems and genetic constraints.</td><td>['Marschall', 'Sagmeister', 'Herwig']</td><td>2017</td><td>Applied microbiology and biotechnology</td><td>Tuning of transcription is a promising strategy to overcome challenges associated with a non-suitable expression rate like outgrowth of segregants, inclusion body formation, metabolic burden and inefficient translocation.

Some tunable systems are registered for patents or already commercially available. Within this contribution, we discuss the induction mechanisms of various Escherichia coli inherent promoter systems with respect to their tunability and review studies using these systems for expression tuning. According to the current level of knowledge, some promoter systems were successfully used for expression tuning, and in some cases, analytical evidence on single-cell level is still pending. However, only a few studies using tunable strains apply a suitable process control strategy. So far, expression tuning has only gathered little attention, but we anticipate that expression tuning harbours great potential for enabling and optimizing the production of a broad spectrum of products in E. coli.</td><td>['Escherichia coli', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Transcriptional Activation']</td><td>['12052093', '19891007', '9223333', '4330551', '9608745', '10769117', '13696894', '23644285', '10411265', '4570383', '9278503', '19958803', '18955986', '9006051', '22079752', '21261879', '1744033', '1551902', '11422389', '19854903', '12473114', '11294638', '17015655', '2830029', '16166533', '23143106', '8011357', '24976172', '2515417', '20491933', '20718948', '9851993', '11102706', '10852886', '23584782', '25286161', '6377308', '11092865', '23183649', '8998991', '16269719', '11073923', '24586851', '12080425', '24337346', '2405166', '23506076', '18246403', '25069377', '26574509', '15784552', '8757746', '16590055', '16616438', '10534433', '14537822', '23497240', '8230210', '21414326', '3316663', '15528672', '6282256', '4608387', '15805526', '18639640', '11223528', '14973486', '4890117', '18628769', '11739756', '13628682', '22858868', '9600837', '7608087', '10648513', '24338599', '10482501', '14524702', '19215036', '18796603', '2995318', '9495769', '6396375', '16333863', '12897003', '7828862', '2887198', '8425528', '15596360', '3882087', '4935332', '1688950', '241020', '8384447', '22202176', '15529165', '3536861', '24735079', '2691838', '9325432', '16568824', '1974769', '27170324']</td></tr><tr><td>27999893</td><td>A Retrograde Transvenous Embolization Technique with Balloon-Assisted Arterial Aspiration for a Peripheral Arteriovenous Malformation with a Venous Pouch.</td><td>['Kuhara', 'Tanaka', 'Koganemaru', 'Kugiyama', 'Kiyokawa', 'Abe']</td><td>2017</td><td>Cardiovascular and interventional radiology</td><td>Management of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is challenging, and there is no consensus regarding either the ideal approach or the treatment timing.

The hip dislocations can be classified into three groups: early, intermediate and late. Approximately two-thirds of cases can be treated successfully with a non-operative approach. The rest require further surgical intervention. The prerequisite to developing an appropriate treatment strategy is a thorough evaluation to identify the causes of the dislocation. In addition, many factors that contribute to THA dislocation are related to the surgical technique, mainly including component orientation, femoral head diameter, restoration of femoral offset and leg length, cam impingement and condition of the soft tissues. The diagnosis of a dislocated hip is relatively easy because the clinical situation is very typical. Having identified a dislocated hip, the first step is to perform a closed reduction of the implant. After reduction you must perform a computed tomography scan to evaluate the surgical options for treatment of recurrent dislocation that include: revision arthroplasty, modular components exchange, dual-mobility cups, large femoral heads, constrained cups, elimination of impingement and soft tissue procedures. The objective is to avoid further dislocation, a devastating event which is increasing the number of operations on the hip. To obtain this goal is useful to follow an algorithm of treatment, but the best treatment remains prevention.</td><td>['Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip', 'Hip Dislocation', 'Hip Joint', 'Hip Prosthesis', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Reoperation']</td><td>['641088', '22717828', '22700131', '22161085', '11938502', '16950066', '21273156', '18451408', '11679604', '1570136', '24434366', '8596224', '991523', '22179979', '21550768', '15190564', '27067470', '16264121', '15577472', '22038174', '12375244', '15523012', '15043107', '20953855', '25381403', '24737147', '22434462', '15466729', '12728414', '8163971', '15343533', '11689368', '1429788', '15577474', '17671025', '23118381', '15118034', '18780135', '10220186', '14668499', '17332097', '11742444', '16601415', '23529633', '14711939', '8376421', '18534522', '11462858', '21531648', '19122087', '3612137', '3809670', '18979146', '12429754', '9917599', '18342029', '24986940', '18057356', '19896063', '15469226', '19070715', '26429197', '8560007', '14566735', '16672895', '14646708', '8301282', '25078366', '9917601', '19298037', '22628588', '21084587', '16326876']</td></tr><tr><td>27999905</td><td>Results of arthroscopic treatment in unresolved Osgood-Schlatter disease in athletes.</td><td>['Circi', 'Beyzadeoglu']</td><td>2017</td><td>International orthopaedics</td><td>In this study we aimed to determine outcomes following arthroscopic ossicle excision in athletes with unresolved Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD).</td><td>['Adult', 'Arthroscopy', 'Athletes', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Knee Joint', 'Male', 'Osteochondrosis', 'Pain', 'Recovery of Function', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sports', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']</td><td>['14764303', '17878797', '4028566', '21410129', '25442658', '4025675', '19448122', '7790481', '11204962', '17916481', '19797569', '7258466', '8461073', '16570735', '14636095', '18760218', '3825408', '7391096', '1277640', '26535345', '8472416', '21141687', '2298897']</td></tr><tr><td>27999906</td><td>Incidence and risk factors for the misplacement of pedicle screws in scoliosis surgery assisted by O-arm navigation-analysis of a large series of one thousand, one hundred and forty five screws.</td><td>['Jin', 'Liu', 'Qiu', 'Yan', 'Han', 'Zhu']</td><td>2017</td><td>International orthopaedics</td><td>To assess the accuracy of O-arm-navigation-based pedicle screw placement in scoliosis surgery and identify the potential risk factors for the misplacement of pedicle screws.</td><td>['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Incidence', 'Lumbar Vertebrae', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Orthopedic Procedures', 'Pedicle Screws', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Scoliosis', 'Surgery, Computer-Assisted', 'Thoracic Vertebrae', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Young Adult']</td><td>['22724594', '25967559', '21901328', '24090516', '10749638', '26272460', '23981926', '23196967', '7642664', '18458588', '16371908', '24967047', '22892631', '20862593', '21275555', '20473117', '21776576', '26987982', '26174053', '24580007', '22614688', '3206294', '26987979', '21037528', '21673628', '17629992']</td></tr><tr><td>27999908</td><td>Acute heart failure with mid-range left ventricular ejection fraction: clinical profile, in-hospital management, and short-term outcome.</td><td>['Farmakis', 'Simitsis', 'Bistola', 'Triposkiadis', 'Ikonomidis', 'Katsanos', 'Bakosis', 'Hatziagelaki', 'Lekakis', 'Mebazaa', 'Parissis']</td><td>2017</td><td>Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society</td><td>Heart failure with mid-range left ventricular ejection fraction (HFmrEF) is a poorly characterized population as it has been studied either in the context of HF with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) depending on applied LVEF cutoffs.

The purified esterases with a molecular mass around 27-29 kDa had their optimum predominantly between pH 7 and 8 at 20-30 °C. Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus fermentum displayed activities against a broad substrate range (methyl caffeate, methyl trans-p-coumarate, chlorogenic acid as well as partially ethyl ferulate). Concerning substrate affinity, reaction velocity, thermal and pH stability, Lactobacillus gasseri showed the overall best performance. The herein studied lactic acid- and bifidobacteria are promising for the production of fermented plant-based foods with an increased quality and nutritional value.</td><td>['Bifidobacterium', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Coumaric Acids', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gene Expression', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Lactobacillus', 'Molecular Weight', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Temperature']</td><td>['9836439', '24825096', '25515139', '15066833', '19502437', '9763694', '18165367', '27052717', '7115300', '23793626', '2449095', '20058325', '22920606', '11412317', '11208940', '16347499', '14661116', '24293730', '9720023', '15784988', '15493526', '17953572', '8338641', '1663152', '942051', '19241534', '17544537', '17951057']</td></tr><tr><td>27999918</td><td>Heat Survival and Phenotype Microarray Profiling of Salmonella Typhimurium Mutants.</td><td>['Dawoud', 'Khatiwara', 'Park', 'Davis', 'Baker', 'Ricke', 'Kwon']</td><td>2017</td><td>Current microbiology</td><td>Contamination of food products by pathogenic microorganisms continues to be a major public health and food industry concern. Non-typhoidal Salmonella species have led to numerous outbreaks associated with various foods. A wide variety of methods have been applied and introduced for treatment of fresh foods to eliminate pathogenic as well as spoilage microorganisms. Salmonella can become exposed to elevated temperatures while associated with hosts such as poultry. In addition, heat treatment is also applied at various stages of processing to retain the shelf life of food products. Despite this, these microorganisms may overcome exposure to such treatments through the efficient expression of stress response mechanisms and result in illness following consumption. Thermal stress induces a range of destructive exposures to bacterial cells such as protein damage and DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species. In this study, we chose three genes (∆recD, ∆STM14_5307, and ∆aroD) associated with conditionally essential genes required for different aspects of optimal growth at 42 °C and evaluated the responses of wild type and mutant Salmonella Typhimurium strains to uncover potential mechanisms that may enable survival and resistance under thermal stress. The RecBCD complex that initiates repair of double-stranded DNA breaks through homologous recombination. STM14_5307 is a transcriptional regulator involved in stationary phase growth and inositol metabolism. The gene aroD is involved in metabolism and stationary phase growth. These strains were characterized via high throughput phenotypic profiling in response to two different growth temperatures (37 °C (human host temperature) and 42 °C (poultry host temperature)). The ∆aroD strain exhibited the highest sensitivity to the various temperatures followed by the ∆recD and ∆STM14_5307 strains, respectively. Achieving more understanding of the molecular mechanisms of heat survival may lead to the development of more effective strategies to limit Salmonella in food products through thermal treatment by developing interventions that specifically target the pathways these genes are involved in.</td><td>['Bacterial Proteins', 'Exodeoxyribonuclease V', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, Regulator', 'Humans', 'Microbial Viability', 'Phenotype', 'Salmonella typhimurium', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Temperature']</td><td>['21455318', '2246142', '23436532', '20492241', '22661691', '12583908', '15183876', '23622497', '16997948', '10840065', '23271832', '7487046', '23637626', '17449687', '12819049', '24184609', '19011032', '20132686', '14573872', '21214695', '16518469', '2126703', '16023758', '11884633', '11751841', '7836281', '18310348', '19054077', '3015881', '24705229', '17875218', '21571882', '23541192', '25587926', '19895479', '8655493', '26540483', '24296573', '20133665', '10963327', '19580447', '24739341', '22367088', '23506360', '16888329', '24588853', '14993306', '10829079', '5774764', '19763168']</td></tr><tr><td>27999919</td><td>FHF2 isoforms differentially regulate Nav1.6-mediated resurgent sodium currents in dorsal root ganglion neurons.</td><td>['Barbosa', 'Xiao', 'Johnson', 'Xie', 'Strong', 'Zhang', 'Cummins']</td><td>2017</td><td>Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology</td><td>Nav1.6 and Nav1.6-mediated resurgent currents have been implicated in several pain pathologies. However, our knowledge of how fast resurgent currents are modulated in neurons is limited. Our study explored the potential regulation of Nav1.6-mediated resurgent currents by isoforms of fibroblast growth factor homologous factor 2 (FHF2) in an effort to address the gap in our knowledge. FHF2 isoforms colocalize with Nav1.6 in peripheral sensory neurons. Cell line studies suggest that these proteins differentially regulate inactivation. In particular, FHF2A mediates long-term inactivation, a mechanism proposed to compete with the open-channel blocker mechanism that mediates resurgent currents. On the other hand, FHF2B lacks the ability to mediate long-term inactivation and may delay inactivation favoring open-channel block. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that FHF2A limits resurgent currents, whereas FHF2B enhances resurgent currents. Overall, our results suggest that FHF2A negatively regulates fast resurgent current by enhancing long-term inactivation and delaying recovery. In contrast, FHF2B positively regulated resurgent current and did not alter long-term inactivation. Chimeric constructs of FHF2A and Navβ4 (likely the endogenous open channel blocker in sensory neurons) exhibited differential effects on resurgent currents, suggesting that specific regions within FHF2A and Navβ4 have important regulatory functions. Our data also indicate that FHFAs and FHF2B isoform expression are differentially regulated in a radicular pain model and that associated neuronal hyperexcitability is substantially attenuated by a FHFA peptide. As such, these findings suggest that FHF2A and FHF2B regulate resurgent current in sensory neurons and may contribute to hyperexcitability associated with some pain pathologies.</td><td>['Action Potentials', 'Animals', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors', 'Ganglia, Spinal', 'Ion Channel Gating', 'Male', 'NAV1.6 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sensory Receptor Cells', 'Sodium']</td><td>['21115638', '22726441', '25724910', '14715935', '24304889', '17101538', '23711479', '7990513', '23097049', '10454712', '10644718', '14946713', '20566860', '24440715', '23622763', '11159440', '21566136', '20679355', '8790420', '25413837', '21817159', '9671787', '15282281', '22705208', '15863036', '21832183', '1280518', '12244047', '12843211', '22978421', '17087118', '25429153', '22493249', '21947499', '26785322', '25686526', '23940261', '18378801', '20800969', '19406745', '20410115', '22265726', '15811336', '26182346', '17766042', '23233218', '12060780', '6209577', '26408173', '12794175', '16817858', '23831029', '19617884', '16192776', '17065247', '10216225', '15981012', '12395088', '24849353', '10580103', '20452967', '12552035', '11376006', '15664175', '20038812', '20367448', '9169512', '16887276', '20816971', '18220257', '25269146', '11378392', '25492945', '12815063', '19150627']</td></tr><tr><td>27999920</td><td>Extracellular phosphates enhance activities of voltage-gated proton channels and production of reactive oxygen species in murine osteoclast-like cells.</td><td>['Li', 'Miura', 'Kuno']</td><td>2017</td><td>Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology</td><td>+ channels may help ROS production.</td><td>['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Ion Channel Gating', 'Macrolides', 'Macrophages', 'Mice', 'NADPH Oxidases', 'Osteoclasts', 'Phosphates', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C', 'Protons', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Sodium', 'Up-Regulation']</td><td>['19720960', '15601753', '19084015', '21406298', '23589829', '17894387', '10432282', '23352164', '24970888', '8568856', '18385273', '16971494', '10823889', '16901940', '20037153', '7836451', '8058781', '12606316', '3024899', '22075694', '3360056', '11559770', '17185330', '2068953', '24081153', '14606521', '26843093', '9239400', '11704500', '15581496', '10029572', '20051526', '15817678', '2456757', '12767054']</td></tr><tr><td>27999921</td><td>The prevalence and risk factors for serositis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a cross-sectional study.</td><td>['Liang', 'Leng', 'Pan', 'Ye']</td><td>2017</td><td>Rheumatology international</td><td>This study aims to estimate the prevalence of serositis and identify risk factors for serositis in a large cohort of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients.

Patients were diagnosed with serositis when they presented with symptoms and signs of pleuritis or/and pericarditis. We explored factors associated with the generation and quantity of serositis by using binary and ordinal logistic regression analysis. Among the 1668 lupus patients, 298 have serositis. Active lupus disease, fever (≥38 °C) and high D-dimer were all significantly associated with the generation and quantity of serositis. Male gender was independent significant risk factor for pleuritis but not for pericarditis, while low complement C4 and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were risk factors for pericarditis rather than for pleuritis. The possible prevalence of serositis in patients with SLE was 17.9%. The significant associations of active lupus disease, fever (≥38 °C) and high D-dimer with serositis suggest that higher disease activity and hypercoagulability may both contribute to the generation and development of serositis in SLE.

Complications may occur in nephrotic syndrome as a result of the disease itself as well as its treatment. Most of these complications result from excessive urinary protein losses, and control of proteinuria is the most effective treatment strategy. Anemia is one of the many complications seen in patients with persistent nephrotic syndrome and may occur as a result of excessive urinary losses of iron, transferrin, erythropoietin, transcobalamin and/or metals. This leads to a deficiency of substrates necessary for effective erythropoiesis, requiring supplementation in order to correct the anemia. Supplementation of iron and erythropoietin alone often does not lead to correction of the anemia, suggesting other possible mechanisms which need further investigation. A clear understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of anemia in nephrotic syndrome is necessary to guide appropriate therapy, but only limited evidence is currently available on the precise etiologic mechanisms of anemia in nephrotic syndrome. In this review we focus on the current state of knowledge on the pathogenesis of anemia in nephrotic syndrome.</td><td>['Anemia', 'Child', 'Epoetin Alfa', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin', 'Gluconates', 'Hematinics', 'Humans', 'Iron', 'Kidney', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Proteinuria', 'Renal Elimination', 'Transferrin', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vitamins']</td><td>['21782802', '18024379', '17556407', '25189324', '6648330', '15468961', '3335323', '7666600', '859066', '18277979', '15133273', '17540841', '19153070', '24456587', '25729394', '1762297', '1246990', '12091602', '17943552', '17043022', '24137020', '26404440', '26518747', '19423745', '27475656', '16921186', '19500646', '23970962', '10080186', '8116687', '6709543', '1708009', '19776721', '15189115', '10442492', '22306005', '11316861', '12641343', '21636722', '22087198', '12940614', '23831624', '6207970', '8201757', '15528156', '20798259', '7531396', '11273873', '25697787', '1443172', '18821709', '7933664']</td></tr><tr><td>27999929</td><td>The single-center experience with the standardization of single-site laparoscopic colectomy for right-sided colon cancer.</td><td>['Takahashi', 'Takemasa', 'Haraguchi', 'Nishimura', 'Hata', 'Yamamoto', 'Matsuda', 'Mizushima', 'Doki', 'Mori']</td><td>2017</td><td>Surgery today</td><td>Complete mesocolic excision (CME) with central vascular ligation (CVL) has been widely accepted as a surgical treatment for right-sided colon cancer.

Several studies have investigated whether non-human primates perceive visual illusions in a human-like fashion, but little attention has been paid to other mammals, and sensitivity to visual illusions has been never investigated in the dog. Here, we studied whether domestic dogs perceive the Delboeuf illusion. In human and non-human primates, this illusion creates a misperception of item size as a function of its surrounding context. To examine this effect in dogs, we adapted the spontaneous preference paradigm recently used with chimpanzees. Subjects were presented with two plates containing food. In control trials, two different amounts of food were presented in two identical plates. In this circumstance, dogs were expected to select the larger amount. In test trials, equal food portion sizes were presented in two plates differing in size: if dogs perceived the illusion as primates do, they were expected to select the amount of food presented in the smaller plate. Dogs significantly discriminated the two alternatives in control trials, whereas their performance did not differ from chance in test trials with the illusory pattern. The fact that dogs do not seem to be susceptible to the Delboeuf illusion suggests a potential discontinuity in the perceptual biases affecting size judgments between primates and dogs.</td><td>['Animals', 'Choice Behavior', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Food', 'Male', 'Optical Illusions', 'Size Perception']</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>27999936</td><td>Postoperative Ileus: Pathophysiology, Current Therapeutic Approaches.</td><td>['Stakenborg', 'Gomez-Pinilla', 'Boeckxstaens']</td><td>2017</td><td>Handbook of experimental pharmacology</td><td>Postoperative ileus, which develops after each abdominal surgical procedure, is an iatrogenic disorder characterized by a transient inhibition of gastrointestinal motility.

In the present experiment, we evaluated the role of AMF on growth, flower production, and concentration of bioactive secondary metabolites (hypericin, pseudohypericin, and hyperforin) of H. perforatum under contrasting P availability. AMF stimulated the production of aboveground biomass under low P conditions and increased the production of root biomass. AMF almost halved the number of flowers per plant by means of a reduction of the number of flower-bearing stems per plant under high P availability and through a lower number of flowers per stem in the low-P treatment. Flower hyperforin concentration was 17.5% lower in mycorrhizal than in non-mycorrhizal plants. On the contrary, pseudohypericin and hypericin concentrations increased by 166.8 and 279.2%, respectively, with AMF under low P availability, whereas no effect of AMF was found under high P availability.

AR application improved grain quality, with increased contents in Glu, Cys, His, Pro, and protein. Twenty-six low-grain HM accumulation-associated protein species were identified and categorized as physiological functions via two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) and mass spectrometry.

Recent advances in RNA-seq and tiling microarray technologies have revealed the presence of many lincRNAs across plant species. This review focuses on the functions of lincRNAs that have been recently reported in plants. One of the most well characterized functions of lincRNAs is to epigenetically regulate gene expression by recruiting proteins for chromosome modification to specific loci. Second, lincRNAs are known to inhibit the physical interaction between microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target mRNAs thus controling protein levels of the target mRNAs.

Cryopreservation methods have been implemented in genebanks as a strategy to back-up plant genetic resource collections that are vegetatively propagated. Cryopreservation is frequently performed using vitrification methods, whereby shoot tips are treated with cryoprotectant solutions, such as Plant Vitrification Solution 2 (PVS2) or Plant Vitrification Solution 3 (PVS3); these solutions remove and/or replace freezable water within the meristem cells. We used the model system Arabidopsis thaliana to identify suites of transcripts that are up- or downregulated in response to PVS2 and PVS3 treatment and liquid nitrogen (LN) exposure. Our results suggest that there are many changes in transcript expression in shoot tips as a result of cryoprotection and that these changes exceed the number detected as a result of LN exposure. In total, 180 transcripts showed significant changes in expression level unique to treatment with either the cryoprotectant or cryopreservation followed by recovery. Of these 180 transcripts, 67 were related to stress, defense, wounding, lipid, carbohydrate, abscisic acid, oxidation, temperature (cold/heat), or osmoregulation. The responses of five transcripts were confirmed using qPCR methods. The transcripts responding to PVS2 + LN suggest an oxidative response to this treatment, whereas the PVS3 + LN treatment invoked a more general metabolic response. This work shows that the choice of cryoprotectant can have a major influence on the patterns of transcript expression, presumably due to the level and extent of stress experienced by the shoot tip. As a result, there may be divergent responses of study systems to PVS2 and PVS3 treatments.</td><td>['Arabidopsis', 'Cryopreservation', 'Cryoprotective Agents', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Gene Ontology', 'Meristem', 'Nitrogen', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']</td><td>['19947982', '24226373', '16321367', '21359674', '26104871', '17603746', '26408853', '20359523', '12789420', '24834923', '19246619', '25489814', '12805589', '21421703', '19783066', '14580849', '24858678', '22195004', '16343474', '16321368', '23404561', '26373654', '24094052', '24575108', '20738108', '21600397', '17256069', '16166256']</td></tr><tr><td>27999956</td><td>Auxin synthesis gene tms1 driven by tuber-specific promoter alters hormonal status of transgenic potato plants and their responses to exogenous phytohormones.</td><td>['Kolachevskaya', 'Sergeeva', 'Floková', 'Getman', 'Lomin', 'Alekseeva', 'Rukavtsova', 'Buryanov', 'Romanov']</td><td>2017</td><td>Plant cell reports</td><td>Ectopic auxin overproduction in transgenic potato leads to enhanced productivity accompanied with concerted and occasional changes in hormonal status, and causing altered response of transformants to exogenous auxin or cytokinin. Previously, we generated potato transformants expressing Agrobacterium-derived auxin synthesis gene tms1 driven by tuber-specific patatin gene promoter (B33-promoter). Here, we studied the endogenous hormonal status and the response to exogenous phytohormones in tms1 transformants cultured in vitro. Adding indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) or kinetin to culture medium affected differently tuberization of tms1-transformed and control plants, depending also on sucrose content in the medium. Exogenous phytohormones ceased to stimulate the tuber initiation in transformants at high (5-8%) sucrose concentration, while in control plants the stimulation was observed in all experimental settings. Furthermore, exogenous auxin partly inhibited the tuber initiation, and exogenous cytokinin reduced the average tuber weight in most transformants at high sucrose content. The elevated auxin level in tubers of the transformants was accompanied with a decrease in content of cytokinin bases and their ribosides in tubers and most shoots. No concerted changes in contents of abscisic, jasmonic, salicylic acids and gibberellins in tubers were detected. The data on hormonal status indicated that the enhanced productivity of tms1 transformants was due to auxin and not mediated by other phytohormones. In addition, exogenous cytokinin was shown to upregulate the expression of genes encoding orthologs of auxin receptors. Overall, the results showed that tms1 expression and local increase in IAA level in transformants affect both the balance of endogenous cytokinins and the dynamics of tuberization in response to exogenous hormones (auxin, cytokinin), the latter reaction depending also on the carbohydrate supply.

Reduced productivity and significant yield loss are the adverse effects of environmental conditions on physiological and biochemical pathways in crop plants. In this context, understanding the epigenetic machinery underlying the tolerance traits in a naturally stress tolerant crop is imperative. Foxtail millet (Setaria italica) is known for its better tolerance to abiotic stresses compared to other cereal crops. In the present study, methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) technique was used to quantify the salt-induced methylation changes in two foxtail millet cultivars contrastingly differing in their tolerance levels to salt stress. The study highlighted that the DNA methylation level was significantly reduced in tolerant cultivar compared to sensitive cultivar. A total of 86 polymorphic MSAP fragments were identified, sequenced and functionally annotated. These fragments showed sequence similarity to several genes including ABC transporter, WRKY transcription factor, serine threonine-protein phosphatase, disease resistance, oxidoreductases, cell wall-related enzymes and retrotransposon and transposase like proteins, suggesting salt stress-induced methylation in these genes. Among these, four genes were chosen for expression profiling which showed differential expression pattern between both cultivars of foxtail millet. Altogether, the study infers that salinity stress induces genome-wide DNA demethylation, which in turn, modulates expression of corresponding genes.</td><td>['DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Methylation', 'Plant Proteins', 'Salinity', 'Salt-Tolerance', 'Setaria Plant', 'Sodium Chloride']</td><td>['23691254', '10954592', '22984395', '17948278', '26635818', '21193578', '7501463', '24987298', '9079881', '21092236', '17139298', '24351809', '25409524', '11846609', '24466268', '17273870', '15831376', '16615868', '11247604', '21930101', '21601090', '15939662', '24086583', '21197597', '22761959', '27585852', '26583030', '21207033', '17913288', '24244664', '21221699', '21057207', '17559516', '17951457', '15181203', '23719757', '26319557', '25752530', '15319229', '25709610', '19179104', '27097755', '25279462', '24915771', '25239219', '25849294', '27586959', '14732436', '22985089', '10323223', '16684525', '20208518', '23382459']</td></tr><tr><td>27999960</td><td>Phospholipids in mitochondrial dysfunction during hemorrhagic shock.</td><td>['Leskova']</td><td>2017</td><td>Journal of bioenergetics and biomembranes</td><td>\"Energy deficiency plays a key role in the development of irreversible shock conditions.

Functional studies showed that the RNA helicase DDX3 promotes metastasis, but DDX3 expression was never studied in patient samples of metastatic cancer. In order to validate previous functional studies and to evaluate DDX3 as a potential therapeutic target, we investigated DDX3 expression in paired samples of primary and metastatic breast cancer. Samples from 79 breast cancer patients with distant metastases at various anatomical sites were immunohistochemically stained for DDX3. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear DDX3 expression were compared between primary and metastatic tumors. In addition, the correlation between DDX3 expression and overall survival was assessed. Upregulation of cytoplasmic (28%; OR 3.7; p = 0.002) was common in breast cancer metastases, especially in triple negative (TN) and high grade cases. High cytoplasmic DDX3 levels were most frequent in brain lesions (65%) and significantly correlated with high mitotic activity and triple negative subtype. In addition, worse overall survival was observed for patients with high DDX3 expression in the metastasis (HR 1.79, p = 0.039). Overall, we conclude that DDX3 expression is upregulated in distant breast cancer metastases, especially in the brain and in TN cases. In addition, high metastatic DDX3 expression correlates with worse survival, implying that DDX3 is a potential therapeutic target in metastatic breast cancer, in particular in the clinically important group of TN patients.</td><td>['Brain Neoplasms', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Prognosis', 'Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms']</td><td>['27009393', '26364611', '26541825', '18846110', '20863372', '19723875', '25256708', '25343452', '24625110', '18596238', '16809785', '22150006', '19576624', '11790298', '15507209', '25043297', '19793905', '23764425', '19262567', '25820276', '23696831', '26337079', '23251644', '21237216', '25406365', '25417118', '12242180', '20549749', '18264132', '19643597', '23584477', '21472002', '21472708', '26358708', '21883093', '25382417', '26365179', '17308085', '23527197', '27135926', '25056374', '18628297', '23413191', '16301996', '27634756', '24948741', '16951164', '26311743', '22820256']</td></tr><tr><td>27999962</td><td>Can lymphovascular invasion be predicted by preoperative multiphasic dynamic CT in patients with advanced gastric cancer?</td><td>['Ma', 'Liang', 'Huang', 'He', 'Liang', 'Chen', 'Huang', 'Xiong', 'Liu']</td><td>2017</td><td>European radiology</td><td>To determine whether multiphasic dynamic CT can preoperatively predict lymphovascular invasion (LVI) in advanced gastric cancer (AGC).</td><td>['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Vessels', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Lymphatic Vessels', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Observer Variation', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Preoperative Care', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stomach Neoplasms', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']</td><td>['19259725', '26024846', '21828149', '11528248', '11976409', '18546037', '20668380', '23883240', '21105140', '19247666', '26756409', '21480240', '14320675', '26700359', '10357403', '16371738', '26385006', '25947284', '26242583', '14605635', '21362331', '24151383', '24186883', '27133704', '25341166', '20409751', '10965312', '18055874', '16020558', '14640995', '19075275']</td></tr><tr><td>27999963</td><td>Is there an Added Value of T1-Weighted Contrast-Enhanced Fat-suppressed Spin-Echo MR Sequences Compared to STIR Sequences in MRI of the Foot and Ankle?</td><td>['Zubler', 'Zanetti', 'Dietrich', 'Espinosa', 'Pfirrmann', 'Mamisch-Saupe']</td><td>2017</td><td>European radiology</td><td>To prospectively compare T1-weighted fat-suppressed spin-echo magnetic resonance (MR) sequences after gadolinium application (T1wGdFS) to STIR sequences in patients with acute and chronic foot pain.</td><td>['Acute Pain', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Ankle', 'Ankle Joint', 'Bone Diseases', 'Chronic Pain', 'Contrast Media', 'Female', 'Foot', 'Foot Joints', 'Gadolinium', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Tendons', 'Young Adult']</td><td>['22865271', '25287952', '26887801', '23418080', '21930225', '11046169', '25017677', '11037444', '843571', '12147843', '15680103', '25636414', '25935824', '19671817', '11037437', '26583367']</td></tr><tr><td>27999964</td><td>MRI of endolymphatic hydrops in patients with Meniere's disease: a case-controlled study with a simplified classification based on saccular morphology.</td><td>['Attyé', 'Eliezer', 'Boudiaf', 'Tropres', 'Chechin', 'Schmerber', 'Dumas', 'Krainik']</td><td>2017</td><td>European radiology</td><td>Endolymphatic hydrops (EH) can be studied in patients by MRI.

AtPLC2 might play a role in cell division during embryo-sac development and early embryogenesis. Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) plays an important role in signal transduction during plant development and in the response to various biotic- and abiotic stresses. The Arabidopsis PI-PLC gene family is composed of nine members, named PLC1 to PLC9. Here, we report that PLC2 is involved in female gametophyte development and early embryogenesis. Using two Arabidopsis allelic T-DNA insertion lines with different phenotypic penetrations, we observed both female gametophytic defects and aberrant embryos. For the plc2-1 mutant (Ws background), no homozygous plants could be recovered in the offspring from self-pollinated plants. Nonetheless, plc2-1 hemizygous mutants are affected in female gametogenesis, showing embryo sacs arrested at early developmental stages. Allelic hemizygous plc2-2 mutant plants (Col-0 background) present reduced seed set and embryos arrested at the pre-globular stage with abnormal patterns of cell division. A low proportion (0.8%) of plc2-2 homozygous mutants was found to escape lethality and showed morphological defects and disrupted megagametogenesis. PLC2-promoter activity was observed during early megagametogenesis, and after fertilization in the embryo proper. Immunolocalization studies in early stage embryos revealed that PLC2 is restricted to the plasma membrane. Altogether, these results establish a role for PLC2 in both reproductive- and embryo development, presumably by controlling mitosis and/or the formation of cell-division planes.</td><td>['Arabidopsis', 'Arabidopsis Proteins', 'Blotting, Western', 'Gametogenesis, Plant', 'Glucuronidase', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Ovule', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Seeds', 'Type C Phospholipases']</td><td>['22303279', '19394438', '15634699', '16781889', '22106097', '25670768', '12756538', '26401841', '24913053', '25149227', '15100402', '20927106', '22164284', '12913129', '26868615', '11340187', '17406218', '22007900', '17908156', '18534862', '24451849', '17410169', '18375601', '23093426', '11015615', '16378100', '23878078', '18785997', '17586839', '21775194', '18055603', '9177324', '19690149', '15837704', '21430291', '26676144', '24876254', '12226484', '20429089', '17121277', '26340337', '17172355', '12668629', '17651370', '19736566', '18252844', '19205744', '20088897', '16648366', '26783886', '20876100']</td></tr><tr><td>27999968</td><td>Pot binding as a variable confounding plant phenotype: theoretical derivation and experimental observations.</td><td>['Sinclair', 'Manandhar', 'Shekoofa', 'Rosas-Anderson', 'Bagherzadi', 'Schoppach', 'Sadok', 'Rufty']</td><td>2017</td><td>Planta</td><td>\"Theoretical derivation predicted growth retardation due to pot water limitations, i.e., pot binding. Experimental observations were consistent with these limitations. Combined, these results indicate a need for caution in high-throughput screening and phenotyping. Pot experiments are a mainstay in many plant studies, including the current emphasis on developing high-throughput, phenotyping systems. Pot studies can be vulnerable to decreased physiological activity of the plants particularly when pot volume is small, i.e., \"\"pot binding\"\". It is necessary to understand the conditions under which pot binding may exist to avoid the confounding influence of pot binding in interpreting experimental results. In this paper, a derivation is offered that gives well-defined conditions for the occurrence of pot binding based on restricted water availability. These results showed that not only are pot volume and plant size important variables, but the potting media is critical. Artificial potting mixtures used in many studies, including many high-throughput phenotyping systems, are particularly susceptible to the confounding influences of pot binding. Experimental studies for several crop species are presented that clearly show the existence of thresholds of plant leaf area at which various pot sizes and potting media result in the induction of pot binding even though there may be no immediate, visual plant symptoms. The derivation and experimental results showed that pot binding can readily occur in plant experiments if care is not given to have sufficiently large pots, suitable potting media, and maintenance of pot water status.

The carrot root is well divided into two different tissues separated by vascular cambium: the secondary phloem and xylem. The equilibrium between these two tissues represents an important issue for carrot quality, but the knowledge about the respective carotenoid accumulation is sparse. The aim of this work was (i) to investigate if variation in carotenoid biosynthesis gene expression could explain differences in carotenoid content in phloem and xylem tissues and (ii) to investigate if this regulation is differentially modulated in the respective tissues by water-restricted growing conditions. In this work, five carrot genotypes contrasting by their root color were studied in control and water-restricted conditions. Carotenoid content and the relative expression of 13 genes along the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway were measured in the respective tissues. Results showed that in orange genotypes and the purple one, carotenoid content was higher in phloem compared to xylem. For the red one, no differences were observed. Moreover, in control condition, variations in gene expression explained the different carotenoid accumulations in both tissues, while in water-restricted condition, no clear association between gene expression pattern and variations in carotenoid content could be detected except in orange-rooted genotypes. This work shows that the structural aspect of carrot root is more important for carotenoid accumulation in relation with gene expression levels than the consequences of expression changes upon water restriction.</td><td>['Carotenoids', 'Daucus carota', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Immunoblotting', 'Phloem', 'Plant Roots', 'Xylem']</td><td>['19946704', '18757491', '26752004', '15161208', '11842158', '19523435', '27158781', '24408191', '19636414', '25614987', '12226278', '18326788', '11328886', '17530774', '15923329', '24595399', '22737218', '18162592', '22427026', '10938359', '7640523', '11532178', '17873090', '16699778', '20303820', '12834401']</td></tr><tr><td>27999970</td><td>The Impact of Perceived Need and Relational Factors on Mental Health Service Use Among Generations of Asian Americans.</td><td>['Lee', 'Takeuchi', 'Gellis', 'Kendall', 'Zhu', 'Zhao', 'Ma']</td><td>2017</td><td>Journal of community health</td><td>The present study examined generational differences in the patterns and predictors of formal and informal mental health service utilization among a nationally representative sample of 1850 Asian Americans from the National Latino and Asian American Study.

First- and second-generation Asian Americans, on the other hand, perceived need was independently associated with formal service use, and a significant predictor of informal service use for first generation.

In vertebrates, CTLs have numerous functions, including serum glycoprotein homeostasis, pathogen sensing, and the initiation of immune responses. Myeloid CTLs in innate immunity are mainly expressed by antigen-presenting cells and play a prominent role in the recognition of a variety of pathogens such as fungi, bacteria, viruses, and parasites. However, myeloid CTLs such as the macrophage inducible CTL (Mincle) or Clec-9a may also bind to self-antigens and thus contribute to immune homeostasis. While some CTLs induce pro-inflammatory responses and thereby lead to activation of adaptive immune responses, other CTLs act as inhibitory receptors and dampen cellular functions. Since CTLs are key players in pathogen recognition and innate immunity, targeting CTLs may be a promising strategy for cell-specific delivery of drugs or vaccine antigens and to modulate immune responses.</td><td>['Animals', 'Homeostasis', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Polysaccharides']</td><td>['11910898', '23570314', '19199612', '18490740', '12655774', '28013366', '26956894', '15567854', '14739280', '24685397', '20363321', '12515809', '15245744', '28012131', '25994174', '25942693', '16336259', '22674328', '17502670', '19681073', '17110942', '26497661', '21803640', '26456705', '20164423', '19095961', '3009480', '26673133', '16177066', '21575914', '12515819', '26553286', '27358401', '19139169', '21334257', '11017109', '3290208', '20303872', '26006324', '19521399', '28277249', '21805335', '19864674', '10721994', '23220043', '25658823', '23606632', '18776906', '26163333', '21487505', '21924922', '23158834', '16698431', '24353272', '25981696', '18511854', '22021370', '12496255', '22246129', '24975478', '20130211', '27782323', '27291962', '24368301', '26407233', '23250433', '26482345', '19703985', '28012132', '27782318', '22433013', '25666591', '18200499', '23103377', '17159982', '17159984', '12730499', '24631154', '22366522', '17462920', '18310320', '23935480', '26117594', '17197236', '27021644', '23918990', '22910394', '27975142', '27314276', '14707091', '20008526', '20567250', '27975143', '21203928', '27377710', '21059925', '24466434', '11884756', '24343653', '26582608', '15940672', '17046204', '25176311', '24304188', '23882266', '25002863', '28013368', '16783855', '23727341', '5128172', '7961705', '26580547', '21616435', '27999995', '23921530', '18204462', '10721995', '17957800', '19171887', '20820666', '20392481', '25068517', '20493731', '12949494']</td></tr><tr><td>27999972</td><td>The sugar code in neuronal physiology.</td><td>['Higuero', 'Díez-Revuelta', 'Abad-Rodríguez']</td><td>2017</td><td>Histochemistry and cell biology</td><td>Carbohydrate-related interactions are necessary for the correct development and function of the nervous system. As we illustrate with several examples, those interactions are controlled by carbohydrate-modifying enzymes and by carbohydrate-binding proteins that regulate a plethora of complex axonal processes. Among others, glycan-related proteins as sialidase Neu3 or galectins-1, -3, and -4 play central roles in the determination of axonal fate, axon growth, guidance and regeneration, as well as in polarized axonal glycoprotein transport. In addition, myelination is also highly dependent on glycans, and the stabilization of myelin architecture requires the interaction of the myelin-associated glycoprotein (siglec-4) with gangliosides in the axonal membrane. The roles of glycans in neuroscience are far from being completely understood, though the cases presented here underscore the importance and potential of carbohydrates to establish with precision key molecular mechanisms of the physiology of the nervous system. New specific applications in diagnosis as well as the definition of new molecular targets to treat neurological diseases related to lectins and/or glycans are envisioned in the future.</td><td>['Animals', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Lectins', 'Neurons', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Polysaccharides']</td><td>['15459394', '10082468', '10624965', '28013366', '26956894', '24685397', '8338665', '21102451', '8978930', '28012131', '7790879', '8995428', '20124415', '26024958', '14682359', '24439382', '11201795', '11606627', '22431161', '15221946', '22212743', '22234579', '19822144', '12374216', '19022387', '21092854', '20006608', '26526326', '26006324', '15647482', '22524425', '2869410', '18509838', '12122071', '19426135', '8833451', '24523539', '11279053', '15194236', '17626205', '23311731', '14676309', '11971864', '25981696', '11283023', '12972410', '15883199', '15555929', '11943804', '7539142', '9201997', '20861448', '28012132', '8570640', '9927419', '1382329', '27511065', '24282076', '8873770', '10769038', '8425542', '21566659', '25936977', '27975142', '22142540', '10567735', '27975143', '19759314', '25151392', '26775177', '27803995', '21693585', '12060784', '28013368', '15546874', '9427242', '27999995', '15834419', '9727835', '8724144', '25941169', '10841374']</td></tr><tr><td>27999974</td><td>Lipid glycosylation: a primer for histochemists and cell biologists.</td><td>['Kopitz']</td><td>2017</td><td>Histochemistry and cell biology</td><td>Glycolipids are glycoconjugates that are predominantly found on the extracellular surface of cells ranging from bacteria to men. In bacteria and plants, glycoglycerolipids represent the main glycolipid species. Ceramides as carrier for glycans, termed glycosphingolipids (GSLs), are characteristic for vertebrates and insects. The glycan part is involved in a variety of biological activities including cell adhesion and initiation of signaling. Most of these functions rest on two basic principles: (1) GSLs spontaneously contribute to organize lipid rafts in biological membranes, thereby forming functional complexes ('glycosynapses') with receptor proteins and ion channels and (2) their glycans are bound by receptors like galectins (protein-glycan recognition) or cognate glycans (glycan-glycan recognition). This interaction modulates cell adhesion, differentiation and growth processes. Besides their contribution to normal cell behavior, GSL expression patterns also influence disease processes by inducing cellular malfunctions when aberrant, as highlighted by inherited disorders of GSL metabolism like sphingolipidoses. Altered GSL patterns are also associated with common neurological diseases, autoimmune diseases and cancer. With respect to infections, various GSL-presented glycans are attachment sites for bacteria and viruses as well as primary targets for bacterial toxins. This review provides an introduction to GSL structures, their nomenclature and metabolism. Building on this, normal and pathological functions of GSL will be surveyed.</td><td>['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Biology', 'Glycolipids', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Lipids']</td><td>['18845618', '17599463', '10407137', '2167157', '1370305', '22230596', '27283907', '14280498', '24711551', '12376725', '28013366', '26956894', '8262898', '23651092', '24295643', '22763744', '9630687', '24685397', '2153431', '27766070', '19293232', '28012131', '12374198', '1350379', '15894491', '10228555', '25408341', '17535296', '27296808', '26024958', '12417425', '3368123', '20695889', '3322696', '26542007', '25448159', '20624157', '22234579', '1739742', '23558543', '21214559', '25151386', '3600316', '22990144', '11101636', '2673013', '7047999', '26553286', '20665623', '26526326', '24911201', '17991443', '6190857', '23717411', '9640458', '13436486', '27697034', '26006324', '8601198', '21805335', '2317562', '22524425', '25604432', '7696850', '22687240', '3081625', '17954214', '18157953', '23611790', '24899306', '8595265', '14043693', '19299701', '8786811', '11201788', '19941856', '26779443', '11773621', '9174666', '23898060', '17626205', '23311731', '11070862', '11350083', '14674750', '25981696', '27261254', '24589479', '8282566', '26498762', '15883199', '164604', '15207828', '12968380', '12803917', '11208904', '26787853', '9780352', '25130318', '21519903', '11445546', '13679866', '8858368', '24985965', '18835549', '24443956', '23865640', '4324310', '15523676', '19457120', '25840516', '22943525', '8003812', '18557633', '28012132', '25115301', '2925645', '24949885', '24909114', '22069729', '21214576', '15277677', '21942574', '15030566', '9826173', '23692629', '19343313', '12223267', '24981556', '21567389', '22565205', '12358786', '7511203', '25553450', '11451961', '22835784', '20731757', '15502825', '23591980', '27319346', '11413487', '25936977', '23746551', '26542149', '27975142', '22410735', '11070863', '24103911', '12646609', '26008784', '27575334', '19958024', '17600724', '16413319', '27975143', '25275038', '18354163', '11890541', '9556610', '6389895', '8049434', '12527358', '27803995', '27427992', '27540730', '26002999', '27999992', '17253773', '827447', '22714832', '12902465', '27558838', '28013368', '20044567', '21788572', '27187342', '9385079', '15454696', '9057819', '20594196', '23873408', '13346373', '2050547', '21576253', '6477558', '20067473', '19192249', '26792806', '15646015', '26340709', '18339196', '14010966', '27720722', '9487542', '19695868', '16409150', '25656452', '11129285', '8724144', '21458998', '27345664', '8839979', '7034483', '25903682', '25941169', '22374719', '16388904', '25450343', '24418318']</td></tr><tr><td>27999975</td><td>Fresh and in vitro osteodifferentiated human amniotic membrane, alone or associated with an additional scaffold, does not induce ectopic bone formation in Balb/c mice.</td><td>['Laurent', 'Nallet', 'de Billy', 'Obert', 'Nicod', 'Meyer', 'Layrolle', 'Zwetyenga', 'Gindraux']</td><td>2017</td><td>Cell and tissue banking</td><td>The human amniotic membrane (hAM) has been successfully used as a natural carrier containing amniotic mesenchymal stromal cells, epithelial cells and growth factors.

We previously reported that hAM represents a natural and preformed sheet containing highly potent stem cells, and could thus be used for bone repair. Indeed, native hAM possesses pre-osteoblastic potential that can easily be stimulated, even as far as mineralization, by means of in vitro osteogenic culture. However, cell culture induces damage to the tissue, as well as to cell phenotype and function. The aim of this study was to evaluate new bone formation by fresh and in vitro osteodifferentiated hAM, alone or associated with an additional scaffold presenting osteoinductive properties. Moreover, we also aimed to determine the effect of in vitro hAM pre-osteodifferentiation on its in vivo biocompatibility/tissue degradation. Results showed that neither fresh nor osteodifferentiated hAM induced ectopic bone formation, whether or not it was associated with the osteoinductive scaffold.

The study included 30 consecutive patients with N1b stage of PTC. All the patients underwent neck dissection (ND) including level I. The relation between involvement of level I LNs and various clinicopathological variables was studied. Unilateral neck dissection was performed in 24 patients and bilateral neck dissection in six patients leading to 36 NDs.

It was not related to the involvement of other individual levels, gender, age, size of the largest thyroid nodule, size of the largest LN involved, or histo-pathological variant of the tumor.
