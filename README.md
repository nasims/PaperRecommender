# Academic Paper Recommender

The aim of this project is to create a recommender system to help researchers and scientists find related articles to a specific paper. There are thousands of papers published everyday and it is not feasible for a researcher to browse all these papers in order to find a related paper to a desired subject. This recommender system helps scientists with their search and saves them a lot of time looking into article resources. 

This repository contains the files for my capstone project 2 on Academic Paper Recommender. The files are as follows:

- getData.ipynb: Code for scraping the data from PubMed
- recommender.ipynb:  Code in jupyter-notebook for finding the recommended papers for a given paper
- Capstone2_MilestoneReport.pdf: Milestone report
- Capstone2_Final_Report.pdf: Project's final report
- Capstone2_Presentation.pdf: Project's presentation
- Capstone2_Proposal.pdf: Project's initial proposal

The recommender.ipynb file can be found on databricks through the following link:
