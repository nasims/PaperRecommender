# PaperRecommender

### The aim of this project is to create a recommender system to help researchers and scientists find related articles to a specific paper. There are thousands of papers published everyday and it is not feasible for a researcher to browse all these papers in order to find a related paper to a desired subject. This recommender system helps scientists with their search and saves them a lot of time looking into article resources.
